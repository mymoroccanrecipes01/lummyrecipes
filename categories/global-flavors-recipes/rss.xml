This promotes more even cooking throughout the bird. While it rests, remove any giblets or neck from the cavity and pat the entire turkey—inside and out—very dry with clean paper towels. Moisture on the skin prevents browning, so this step is critical. You should see bare, pale skin without any visible moisture.</li><li>In a small bowl, mix the kosher salt, black pepper, smoked paprika, and garlic powder. Rub the softened butter directly under the skin of the turkey breast and legs—you can loosen the skin gently with your fingers to work the butter underneath. This insulates the meat and keeps it moist during roasting. Rub the seasoning mixture all over the outside and inside the cavity. Don't skip the inside; the seasoning flavors the cavity, which influences the overall taste.</li><li>Preheat your oven to 325°F. Heat 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large roasting pan (12×16 inches) over medium-high heat on the stovetop until it foams and the foam subsides. Carefully place the turkey breast-side down in the hot pan. You should hear a distinct sizzle. Let it sear for 8–10 minutes without moving it; this develops a flavorful crust on the breast meat. Flip the turkey carefully to breast-side up using kitchen towels or a sturdy pair of tongs. If you're uncomfortable with this, you can skip searing and proceed directly to roasting; it will still cook properly but may not brown as evenly.</li><li>Pour 2.5 cups of chicken broth and ½ cup water into the roasting pan around the turkey (not over it). This liquid maintains the oven's humidity and becomes the base for pan gravy. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh without touching bone. Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil, ensuring the edges are sealed so steam cannot escape rapidly. Place the pan in the preheated 325°F oven.</li><li>Set a timer for 90 minutes, then begin checking the internal temperature every 20 minutes using the thermometer. The thigh should eventually reach 165°F, which is the USDA safe internal temperature. For a 12–14-pound turkey, expect total roasting time of 2 to 2.5 hours. Thighs cook slower than breasts because of their higher bone density and fat content. If you notice the liquid level dropping significantly, add ½ cup more broth to maintain steam production.</li><li>Once the thigh reaches 165°F, remove the turkey from the oven and transfer it to a clean cutting board. Tent it loosely with aluminum foil and let it rest for 20 minutes. During this resting period, residual heat continues cooking the meat while the muscle fibers relax and reabsorb their juices. Carving into a turkey immediately after roasting causes all those reabsorbed juices to run out onto the cutting board instead of staying in the meat. This is why resting produces noticeably juicier results.</li><li>While the turkey roasts, rinse the chopped collard greens thoroughly in a colander under cool water. Collards grow in tight layers and often harbor soil. Pat them dry in paper towels or a salad spinner. Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add the diced onion and sauté for 4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it becomes translucent and softens. This breaks down the onion's cell structure and develops sweetness through gentle caramelization.</li><li>Add the minced garlic to the softened onion and stir continuously for about 1 minute. You'll smell the garlic become fragrant as the heat releases its volatile compounds. Add all the chopped collard greens to the pot, stirring to coat everything with the oil. The greens will seem to overflow; keep stirring, and they'll wilt down significantly within 2–3 minutes. This wilting happens as heat breaks down cell walls and releases moisture. Pour in the chicken broth, then add the kosher salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes if using.</li><li>Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered for 25–35 minutes. The greens should be tender but still have structure—not mushy. The liquid gradually reduces as moisture evaporates. If you notice excessive liquid remaining after 30 minutes, increase the heat slightly to evaporate it faster. Taste a leaf near the end of cooking; you should notice the bitterness has mellowed and a subtle sweetness has developed from the onion and extended cooking.</li><li>While the turkey rests, prepare your cornbread according to package directions or your scratch recipe. Preheat a cast iron skillet (preferred for even browning) or 9-inch round cake pan in a 425°F oven with 2 tablespoons of butter. Once the butter is foaming (about 4 minutes), carefully pour the cornbread batter into the hot pan. The batter should sizzle immediately upon contact. This sizzling is essential—it creates the crispy, golden bottom that distinguishes good cornbread from mediocre.</li><li>Carve the rested turkey into breasts, thighs, and drumsticks, or present the whole bird for family-style serving. Transfer the cornbread to a cutting board or basket and cut into wedges. Arrange the collard greens in a serving bowl. Pour the pan juices from the roasting pan into a gravy boat, skimming excess fat if desired. The pan juices provide the flavorful accompaniment that ties all three components together.</li></ol></div><div style="background:#fff3f3;padding:15px;border-radius:8px;border-left:4px solid #E60023;"><p><strong>📌 Pinterest Tags:</strong> #cat1761229818868 #Mediumrecipe #recipe #cooking #foodie #homemade #delicious</p></div><div style="text-align:center;margin-top:30px;padding:20px;background:#E60023;color:white;border-radius:8px;"><p style="margin:0;"><strong>📌 Save this recipe to Pinterest!</strong></p><p style="margin:5px 0 0 0;">Perfect for meal planning and sharing with friends</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
