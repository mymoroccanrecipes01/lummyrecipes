            <h2>Introduction to LUMMY RECIPES</h2>
            <p>LUMMY RECIPES prioritizes straightforward culinary inspiration alongside responsible privacy practices. Our no-registration approach means we neither collect nor process your personal details directly. We never sell or distribute your data to external parties.</p>

This statement clarifies these mechanisms and outlines our commitment to safeguarding your privacy throughout your lummyrecipes.com experience.</p>
