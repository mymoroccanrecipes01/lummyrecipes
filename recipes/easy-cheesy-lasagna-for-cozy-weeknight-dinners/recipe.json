    "tips": "When cooking the meat, ensure it's well browned for maximum flavor. A common mistake is overcooking the noodles; remember, they’ll continue to cook in the oven. This lasagna can be made ahead of time and stored in the fridge for up to 2 days before baking. If you're looking for a lighter version, try substituting ground turkey for the beef and sausage.",
