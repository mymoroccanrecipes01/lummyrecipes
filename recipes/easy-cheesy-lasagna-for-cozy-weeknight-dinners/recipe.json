    "tips": "When making lasagna, there are a few tricks I’ve learned along the way. First off, I always use Kerrygold butter for greasing the pan—adds a nice flavor. And if you have time, let the lasagna sit for a bit before cutting; it holds together better. Second, using a mix of beef and sausage gives a delicious depth, but you can swap out for ground turkey if you're feeling healthier. Also, don’t skip the fresh basil—adds that fresh kick! If you have leftovers (which, let’s be real, probably won’t happen), they reheat beautifully in the oven. You might lose a little of that crispiness, but still totally satisfying. And if you’re feeling fancy, throw in some sautéed mushrooms or spinach for extra nutrients. Just be careful not to overstuff it; less is more sometimes!",
