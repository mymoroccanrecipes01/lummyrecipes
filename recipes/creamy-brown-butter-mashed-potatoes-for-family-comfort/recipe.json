    "ingredients": [
        "2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cubed",
        "1\/2 cup unsalted butter, browned",
        "1\/2 cup whole milk, warmed",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "Chives, finely chopped for garnish"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Begin by placing the peeled and cubed potatoes into a large pot. Cover them with cold water and add a generous pinch of salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.",
        "Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and let the potatoes simmer until fork-tender, about 15-20 minutes. Drain the potatoes well and return them to the pot.",
        "In a separate pan, melt the butter over medium heat until it turns a golden brown color and develops a nutty aroma. Remove from heat and set aside.",
        "Mash the drained potatoes using a potato masher or ricer until smooth. Gradually incorporate the warm milk and the browned butter, mixing until creamy and well combined.",
        "Season with salt and pepper to taste, adjusting as necessary. Serve the mashed potatoes warm, garnished with freshly chopped chives."
    ],
    "tips": "For the best texture, choose starchy potatoes like russets. Ensure they are cut into even pieces for uniform cooking. When browning the butter, watch closely to prevent burning; it should have a nutty aroma and a rich amber color. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stove with a splash of milk to restore creaminess. If you prefer a lighter version, substitute half of the butter with olive oil.",
