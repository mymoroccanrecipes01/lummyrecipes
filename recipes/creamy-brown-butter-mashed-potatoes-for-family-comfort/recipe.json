    "ingredients": [
        "2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and quartered",
        "1\/2 cup unsalted Kerrygold butter",
        "1\/2 cup whole milk, warmed",
        "Salt, to taste",
        "Freshly ground black pepper, to taste",
        "Optional: chopped fresh chives for garnish"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Start by boiling a large pot of salted water. Add the quartered potatoes and cook them for about 15 minutes until super tender. You wanna make sure they’re soft enough to mash easily.",
        "While the potatoes are cooking, melt the Kerrygold butter in a skillet over medium heat. Keep an eye on it and stir occasionally until it turns golden brown and smells nutty. Seriously, this step is where the magic happens.",
        "Once the potatoes are done, drain them and return them to the pot. Mash them up until smooth. You can use a potato masher or even a ricer (my personal favorite).",
        "Pour the browned butter into the mashed potatoes, along with the warmed milk. Mix everything together until creamy and well combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
        "If you’re feeling fancy, sprinkle some chopped chives on top before serving. They add a nice pop of color and flavor!"
    ],
    "tips": "When it comes to mashed potatoes, the type of potato matters. Russets are starchy and break down nicely, giving you that creamy texture. Always warm your milk (I use it straight from the microwave for about 30 seconds) to keep the mash warm. And, trust me, you can’t overdo the butter here—go for flavor! Also, remember to taste and adjust your seasoning. If you want a little more zing, try adding a dash of garlic powder. If you have leftovers, they reheat beautifully on the stove with a splash of milk to regain that creamy texture. My KitchenAid mixer can also whip them up in no time, just don't overmix or they can get gummy.",

Garlic is another great addition—try roasting a clove and mashing it into the potatoes. If you're feeling adventurous, some cheese (like parmesan) can take it to the next level. Looking for a spice? A hint of smoked paprika adds a nice depth. Also, if you prefer a tangy twist, a splash of sour cream can be a game changer.<\/p>"
