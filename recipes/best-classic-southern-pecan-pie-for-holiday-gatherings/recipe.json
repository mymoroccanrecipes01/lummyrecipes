    "ingredients": [
        "1 pie crust (store-bought or homemade, I use Bob's Red Mill flour for mine)",
        "1 cup light corn syrup",
        "1 cup brown sugar, packed",
        "4 large eggs",
        "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted (Kerrygold is my go-to)",
        "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
        "1 cup pecan halves",
        "Pinch of salt"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Roll out your pie crust and fit it into a 9-inch pie dish. Trim the edges and poke a few holes in the bottom with a fork.",
        "In a large bowl, whisk together the corn syrup, brown sugar, eggs, melted butter, vanilla, and salt until smooth. This part is easy, seriously!",
        "Stir in the pecans until they're all coated in that sweet goodness. Pour the filling into your pie crust, spreading the pecans evenly.",
        "Bake for 45-50 minutes until the filling is set and the crust is golden brown. You’ll know it’s done when the center doesn’t jiggle too much.",
        "Let it cool for at least 2 hours before slicing. This helps it set up nicely. Trust me on this one!"
    ],
    "tips": "If you're looking to take your pecan pie to the next level, try these tips: \n1. Use fresh pecans - they make a huge difference! I always buy mine in bulk from Whole Foods. \n2. If the edges of your crust start browning too quickly, cover them with foil to prevent burning. \n3. Don't skip the cooling time; it helps the filling firm up, so it's not a gooey mess when you slice it. \n4. For a little extra flavor, add a splash of bourbon to the filling - it’s like, a game changer! \n5. Leftovers? Store them in the fridge for up to 4 days; just reheat slices in the microwave for a warm treat later.",

Toasting them before adding to the pie brings out their flavor. <strong>Key seasonings\/aromatics:<\/strong> Vanilla extract adds warmth, while a pinch of salt balances the sweetness. I recommend using pure vanilla for the best taste. <strong>Supporting ingredients:<\/strong> The corn syrup and brown sugar create that gooey texture. Make sure to mix them well to avoid clumps. <strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> If you need a lighter option, try using maple syrup instead of corn syrup; it gives a unique flavor. You could also use chopped walnuts instead of pecans for a different twist. <strong>Equipment needed:<\/strong> A good pie dish is key; I love using my trusty glass pie plate for even baking.<\/p>"
