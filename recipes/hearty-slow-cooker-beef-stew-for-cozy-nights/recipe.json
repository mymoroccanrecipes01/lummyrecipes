    "tips": "One key tip is to brown the beef before adding it to the slow cooker; this enhances the flavor significantly. A common mistake is not seasoning enough—don’t be shy with the salt and pepper! Leftovers store well in the fridge for up to three days, and you can easily reheat them on the stove. If you want to make it lighter, swap out the potatoes for more veggies like green beans or peas.",
