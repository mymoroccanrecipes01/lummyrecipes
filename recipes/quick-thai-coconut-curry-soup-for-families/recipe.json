    "tips": "To elevate your Thai coconut curry dumpling soup, consider these professional chef tips: \n- When selecting dumplings, opt for those filled with vegetables or shrimp for added flavor. Ensure they are cooked through by checking the packaging instructions. \n- Fresh herbs like basil or mint can enhance the soup's aroma and taste. Add them just before serving for maximum freshness. \n- Avoid overcooking the spinach; it should remain vibrant and tender. Add it at the end of cooking to preserve its nutrients and color. \n- For storage, keep the soup in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stove to maintain the texture of the dumplings. \n- Adjust the spice level by adding more or less curry paste according to your preference. Taste as you go to find the perfect balance.",
