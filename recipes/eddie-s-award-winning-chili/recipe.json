    "tips": "To elevate your chili, consider these professional tips: \n- Use a combination of meats for depth of flavor; beef and pork create a rich base. \n- Allow the chili to rest for a few hours or overnight in the fridge; flavors deepen as it sits. \n- When reheating, add a splash of broth to restore consistency. \n- Avoid overcooking the beans; they should be tender but not mushy. \n- Experiment with different beans or add corn for a twist; each ingredient adds unique texture and flavor.",
