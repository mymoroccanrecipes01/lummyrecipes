    "ingredients": [
        "1 pound ground beef",
        "1/2 cup breadcrumbs",
        "1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese",
        "1 egg, beaten",
        "2 cloves garlic, minced",
        "1/4 cup chopped green onions",
        "1/2 teaspoon salt",
        "1/4 teaspoon black pepper",
        "1/2 cup honey",
        "1/4 cup soy sauce",
        "1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.",
        "In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, beaten egg, minced garlic, green onions, salt, and pepper. Mix until just combined.",
        "Form the mixture into small meatballs, about 1 inch in diameter, and place them on the prepared baking sheet.",
        "Bake the meatballs for 15-20 minutes, or until they are browned and cooked through.",
        "While the meatballs are baking, whisk together honey, soy sauce, and apple cider vinegar in a small saucepan. Heat over medium until it simmers, then reduce the heat and let it thicken slightly.",
        "Once the meatballs are done, toss them in the honey garlic sauce and serve warm with toothpicks."

    "tips": "For extra flavor, try adding a splash of sriracha to the honey garlic sauce for a spicy kick. A common mistake is overmixing the meatball mixture, which can lead to tough meatballs—mix just until combined. If you have leftovers, store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to three days, and reheat gently in the microwave or on the stovetop.",
