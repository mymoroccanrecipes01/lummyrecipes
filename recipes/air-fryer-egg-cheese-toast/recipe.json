    "ingredients": [
        "2 slices of your favorite bread, thick-cut",
        "2 large eggs",
        "1/2 cup shredded cheese, such as cheddar or mozzarella",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "Butter or cooking spray for greasing"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your air fryer to 350°F (175°C) for about 5 minutes to ensure even cooking.",
        "While the air fryer heats, lightly butter one side of each slice of bread and place them butter-side down on a cutting board.",
        "Crack an egg onto each slice of bread, being careful not to break the yolk. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
        "Sprinkle the shredded cheese generously over the eggs, covering them completely.",
        "Carefully transfer the prepared toast into the air fryer basket and cook for 8-10 minutes, or until the eggs are set and the cheese is bubbly and golden.",
        "Once done, remove the toast from the air fryer and let it cool for a minute before serving."
    ],
    "tips": "For the best results, choose a bread that can hold up to the egg's moisture, like sourdough or whole grain. If you prefer a runny yolk, check the eggs at 8 minutes; they may be perfect for your taste. To add a flavor boost, consider mixing herbs like chives or parsley into the egg before cooking. If you're making multiple servings, you can prepare them in batches, but be mindful of the cooking time as it may vary slightly. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two days, and reheat in the air fryer for a quick breakfast fix.",
