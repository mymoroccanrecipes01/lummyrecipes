    "ingredients": [
        "4 medium zucchinis, sliced into half-moons",
        "1 red bell pepper, julienned",
        "1 cup snap peas, trimmed",
        "3 cloves garlic, minced",
        "2 tablespoons soy sauce",
        "1 tablespoon sesame oil",
        "1 tablespoon olive oil",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "Sesame seeds for garnish"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Begin by heating the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the minced garlic and sauté for about 30 seconds until fragrant.",
        "Add the sliced zucchinis and bell pepper to the skillet, stirring frequently for about 5 minutes until they begin to soften.",
        "Incorporate the snap peas and continue to stir-fry for another 3-4 minutes until all vegetables are tender yet crisp.",
        "Pour in the soy sauce and sesame oil, tossing everything together to ensure even coating. Cook for an additional 2 minutes.",
        "Season with salt and pepper to taste, then remove from heat. Transfer to a serving dish and sprinkle with sesame seeds before serving."
    ],
    "tips": "To enhance the flavor of your stir-fry, consider using fresh ginger along with garlic for a zesty kick. When selecting zucchinis, look for firm ones with shiny skin, as they are fresher and more flavorful. Avoid overcooking the vegetables; they should retain a slight crunch for the best texture. For storage, keep leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in a skillet over medium heat for about 5 minutes until warmed through, adding a splash of water to maintain moisture. If you want to make this dish heartier, serve it over cooked rice or quinoa.",
