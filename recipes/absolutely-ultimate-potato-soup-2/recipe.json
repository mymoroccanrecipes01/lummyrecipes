    "instructions": [
        "Place bacon in a Dutch oven and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, 5 to 10 minutes.",
        "Drain bacon pieces on paper towels and reserve 1\/4 cup of the bacon grease in the pan; discard the rest.",

        "Stir in garlic and continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes.",
