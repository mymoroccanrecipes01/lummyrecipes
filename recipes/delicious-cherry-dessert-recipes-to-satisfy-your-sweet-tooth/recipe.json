    "ingredients": [
        "2 cups fresh cherries, pitted and halved",
        "1 cup granulated sugar",
        "1 tablespoon cornstarch",
        "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
        "1 tablespoon lemon juice",
        "1 pre-made pie crust",
        "1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)",
        "Powdered sugar for dusting"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Roll out the pie crust and fit it into a tart pan, trimming any excess dough.",
        "In a mixing bowl, combine the halved cherries, granulated sugar, cornstarch, vanilla extract, and lemon juice. Toss until the cherries are well coated.",
        "Pour the cherry mixture into the prepared crust, spreading it evenly. Brush the edges of the crust with the beaten egg for a golden finish.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling.",
        "Remove from the oven and let it cool for at least 15 minutes before slicing. Dust with powdered sugar before serving."
    ],
    "tips": "To ensure your tart crust is flaky, avoid overworking the dough when rolling it out. For the best flavor, use ripe, fresh cherries, and consider adding a pinch of almond extract for an extra layer of flavor. If you have leftover tart, store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat slices in the oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 10 minutes to enjoy it warm. Always check the tart for doneness by looking for a bubbling filling and a golden crust.",
