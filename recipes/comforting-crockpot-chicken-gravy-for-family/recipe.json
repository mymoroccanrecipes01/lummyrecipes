    "ingredients": [
        "4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts",
        "1 can (10.5 oz) cream of chicken soup",
        "1 packet (1 oz) ranch seasoning mix",
        "1 cup chicken broth",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "Chopped parsley for garnish"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Begin by placing the chicken breasts at the bottom of your crockpot. Season them lightly with salt and pepper.",
        "In a separate bowl, mix together the cream of chicken soup, ranch seasoning, and chicken broth until well combined.",
        "Pour the mixture over the chicken in the crockpot, ensuring the chicken is well coated.",
        "Cover the crockpot and cook on low for about 4 hours, or until the chicken is tender and easily shredded.",
        "Once cooked, shred the chicken with two forks and stir it back into the gravy before serving.",
        "Garnish with chopped parsley for a pop of color and serve warm."
    ],
    "tips": "To ensure your chicken remains juicy, avoid overcooking it in the crockpot. Use fresh herbs like thyme or rosemary for an aromatic twist. If you prefer a thicker gravy, mix a tablespoon of cornstarch with water and stir it in during the last 30 minutes of cooking. For meal prep, this dish can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stove or in the microwave, adding a splash of broth if needed to loosen the gravy.",
