    "ingredients": [
        "4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts",
        "1 can (10.5 oz) cream of chicken soup",
        "1 packet (1 oz) ranch dressing mix",
        "1 cup chicken broth",
        "1 tablespoon olive oil",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "Chopped parsley for garnish"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "First up, drizzle some olive oil in your crockpot. Just a tablespoon, no need to go crazy.",
        "Next, season your chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Yeah, you wanna make sure they’re flavorful.",
        "Add the chicken to the crockpot, then dump in the cream of chicken soup and the ranch dressing mix. Smells good already, right?",
        "Pour in the chicken broth over everything. It’s like, seriously, this is gonna be so easy.",
        "Cover and cook on low for about 4 hours. You’ll know it’s done when the chicken is tender and shreddable.",
        "Shred the chicken right in the pot, mix it all together, and serve it up over mashed potatoes or rice. So good!"
    ],
    "tips": "Now, let me drop some knowledge here. First, using a good quality chicken broth makes a big difference. I like to use KitchenAid to mix my ingredients for a smoother blend. Second, you can totally swap out chicken breasts for thighs if you prefer. They’re juicier, but whatever you go with, just make sure they’re not frozen! Also, if you wanna add some veggies, throw in some carrots or peas halfway through cooking. They’ll add color and nutrition. And trust me, leftovers are even better the next day. Just store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stove or in the microwave. Seriously, this dish is a lifesaver for busy weeknights.",

My go-to is Hidden Valley, but any brand will do. <strong>Supporting ingredients:<\/strong> Cream of chicken soup binds everything together and adds a rich creaminess. Trust me, I always opt for Campbell's. <strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> You can use turkey instead of chicken if that’s what you have, or even a plant-based chicken alternative for a vegetarian spin. <strong>Equipment needed:<\/strong> A good crockpot is essential; I use my trusty KitchenAid one which is perfect for even cooking.<\/p>"
