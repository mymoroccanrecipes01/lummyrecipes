    "ingredients": [
        "2 ½ cups all-purpose flour, sifted",
        "2 cups granulated sugar",
        "1 cup unsalted butter, softened",
        "4 large eggs",
        "1 cup whole milk",
        "1 tablespoon vanilla extract",
        "1 tablespoon baking powder",
        "½ teaspoon salt",
        "Food coloring for decoration",
        "Fondant for shaping and covering",
        "Edible glitter and sprinkles for finishing touches"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease two 9-inch round cake pans. Line the bottoms with parchment paper for easy removal.",
        "In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 3-4 minutes.",
        "Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Then stir in the vanilla extract.",
        "In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add this dry mixture to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk, and mix until just combined.",
        "Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans and smooth the tops. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.",
        "Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely. Once cooled, decorate with fondant and your choice of colorful designs."
    ],
    "tips": "To achieve the best results with your whimsical cakes, consider these professional tips: First, ensure your butter is at room temperature for easy creaming with sugar. This helps create a light texture. When adding food coloring, start with a small amount and gradually increase to achieve your desired shade. For fondant decorations, knead it well to make it pliable before shaping. If you're new to fondant, practice on a small piece first. Store your cakes in an airtight container at room temperature for up to three days, or refrigerate for longer freshness. When reheating, use a microwave for short intervals to avoid drying out the cake.",
