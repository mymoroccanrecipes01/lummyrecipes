        "2 cups quinoa, rinsed and drained",
        "1 pound chicken breast, diced",
        "1 bell pepper, chopped",
        "1 zucchini, sliced",
        "1 cup broccoli florets",
        "2 tablespoons olive oil",
        "1 teaspoon garlic powder",
        "1 teaspoon paprika",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "Fresh herbs for garnish"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Begin by cooking the quinoa according to package instructions, usually about 15 minutes until fluffy.",
        "While the quinoa cooks, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced chicken and season with garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper.",
        "Sauté the chicken for about 7-10 minutes until golden brown and cooked through. Remove from the skillet and set aside.",
        "In the same skillet, add the chopped bell pepper, zucchini, and broccoli. Stir-fry for about 5-7 minutes until the vegetables are tender yet crisp.",
        "Combine the cooked quinoa with the sautéed chicken and vegetables, mixing well to incorporate all flavors.",
        "Serve immediately or portion into meal prep containers, garnishing with fresh herbs."
    ],
    "tips": "1. For added flavor, marinate the chicken in your favorite dressing or spices for at least 30 minutes before cooking. 2. Feel free to swap out the vegetables based on your preferences or what’s in season. Carrots, spinach, or snap peas work great too! 3. To ensure the quinoa cooks perfectly, use a 2:1 water-to-quinoa ratio and let it rest covered for 5 minutes after cooking. 4. Store meal prep containers in the fridge for up to 4 days. Reheat in the microwave for 2-3 minutes, ensuring the chicken is heated through. 5. Experiment with different protein sources like tofu or shrimp for variety in your meal prep.",
