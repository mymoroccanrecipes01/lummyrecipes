    "ingredients": [
        "8 ounces elbow macaroni, cooked and drained",
        "2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese, divided",
        "1 cup milk",
        "1\/2 cup heavy cream",
        "1\/4 cup unsalted Kerrygold butter",
        "1\/4 cup all-purpose flour, Bob's Red Mill recommended",
        "1 teaspoon garlic powder",
        "1 teaspoon onion powder",
        "Salt and black pepper to taste",
        "1\/2 cup breadcrumbs for topping"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). While that's happening, grab a large pot and melt the Kerrygold butter over medium heat.",
        "Whisk in the Bob's Red Mill flour to create a roux, stirring for about 2 minutes until it’s bubbling. You want it to be a light golden color, kinda like a tan.",
        "Slowly pour in the milk and heavy cream while whisking continuously. Bring it to a gentle simmer and watch for it to thicken, which takes about 5 minutes.",
        "Stir in 1 1\/2 cups of the cheddar cheese along with the garlic powder and onion powder. Keep stirring until everything is melted and creamy. Then, mix in the cooked macaroni and season with salt and pepper.",
        "Transfer the mac and cheese to a greased baking dish. Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top, then add breadcrumbs. Bake for 20-25 minutes until it’s all bubbly and golden on top."
    ],
    "tips": "First off, make sure your cheese is freshly shredded. Pre-packaged stuff? Nah, it doesn’t melt the same way. If you want a bit of spice, add some cayenne pepper to the mix. And honestly, if you’re feeling fancy, toss in some cooked bacon bits or even lobster for a treat! I always make extra because leftovers taste even better the next day. If you're reheating, just add a splash of milk to keep it creamy.",

My dad even said it’s better than his mom’s (I know, I know!).<\/p>"

            "content": "<p><strong>Main ingredient (macaroni):<\/strong> I always use elbow macaroni because it holds the sauce well. Look for the kind that’s sturdy and not too soft. Cook it al dente so it doesn’t get mushy in the oven.<\/p><p><strong>Key seasonings\/aromatics:<\/strong> Garlic and onion powders really amp up the flavor. I prefer using fresh garlic sometimes, but the powders are super convenient.<\/p><p><strong>Supporting ingredients:<\/strong> Cream and cheese contribute to that rich, creamy texture. I recommend using sharp cheddar for a stronger flavor profile. Mix in some Gruyère if you’re feeling fancy!<\/p><p><strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> If you don’t have heavy cream, half-and-half works too. Want a lighter version? Use low-fat milk, though it won’t be as rich. And for a gluten-free option, swap the elbow macaroni for quinoa or gluten-free pasta.<\/p><p><strong>Equipment needed:<\/strong> A sturdy pot is essential for making the cheese sauce, and a good baking dish like my trusty Pyrex makes all the difference when it comes to even cooking.<\/p>"

This usually takes about 5 minutes over medium heat, and you should see it bubble slightly.<\/p><p>Finishing touches: Once it’s all combined, transfer to your baking dish, sprinkle with cheese and breadcrumbs, then pop it in the oven. It should be golden and bubbly in about 20-25 minutes. Just watch for that crispy top that’ll have everyone excited!<\/p>"
