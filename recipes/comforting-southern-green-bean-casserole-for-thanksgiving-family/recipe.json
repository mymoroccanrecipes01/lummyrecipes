    "tips": "To elevate your Southern green bean casserole, consider these chef tips: \n- For a deeper flavor, sauté some diced onions and mushrooms in butter before adding them to the casserole mix. This adds a lovely umami depth. \n- Ensure your green beans are fresh and vibrant; they should snap when bent. Avoid overcooking them during blanching to maintain their crispness. \n- If you want a bit of heat, add a pinch of cayenne pepper to the creamy mixture. It enhances the flavor without overwhelming the dish. \n- Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 15 minutes to restore the crispy topping. \n- For a twist, try adding cooked bacon bits or diced ham for a smoky flavor that complements the creaminess.",
