    "ingredients": [
        "1 pound fresh green beans, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces",
        "1 can (10.5 oz) cream of mushroom soup (I use Campbell's)",
        "1\/2 cup milk (any kind works, I like whole milk)",
        "1 cup shredded cheddar cheese (I always use Tillamook)",
        "1 cup crispy fried onions (like French's)",
        "Salt and pepper to taste"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Get that warmth going while you prep!",
        "In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the green beans for about 5 minutes until they're bright green but still crisp. Drain and set aside.",
        "In a mixing bowl, whisk together the cream of mushroom soup and milk until smooth. Add in the cheddar cheese and stir until blended. Season with salt and pepper to your liking.",
        "Combine the cooked green beans with the soup mixture in a large casserole dish. Mix until the beans are well coated.",
        "Top the casserole with crispy fried onions. You can either sprinkle them on lightly or pile them high (I usually go for high!).",
        "Bake for about 25 minutes or until the edges are bubbly and the top is golden brown. Let it cool for a few minutes before serving."

    "tips": "When making this casserole, a few things can make or break your dish. First off, choose fresh green beans - they really do taste better than frozen. If you're short on time, frozen is fine, but trust me, fresh is worth it! And don't skimp on the cheese; a good melting cheese like Tillamook really adds flavor and creaminess. My KitchenAid mixer is a lifesaver for mixing the soup and milk together smoothly. Also, if you want extra crunch, add more crispy onions on top just before serving. And leftovers? They’re even better the next day. Just reheat in the oven - microwave can make it soggy.",
