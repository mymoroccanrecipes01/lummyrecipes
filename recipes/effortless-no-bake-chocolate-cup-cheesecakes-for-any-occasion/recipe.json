A common mistake is overmixing the whipped cream, which can lead to a dense texture—just fold gently! These cheesecakes can be stored in the fridge for up to three days, making them perfect for make-ahead desserts.",

            "content": "<p>To create these delightful cheesecakes, you'll need crushed chocolate cookies for the base, which adds that rich flavor and crunch. I usually use Oreos, but any chocolate cookie will work. The cream cheese and heavy cream create a luscious texture, while the melted chocolate gives it that irresistible flavor. If you're looking for a lighter version, you could substitute the cream cheese with Greek yogurt, but keep in mind it will alter the taste a bit.</p>"

The key is to fold the whipped cream gently into the cream cheese mixture to keep it light and airy. Once assembled, a few hours in the fridge is all they need to set perfectly.</p>"
