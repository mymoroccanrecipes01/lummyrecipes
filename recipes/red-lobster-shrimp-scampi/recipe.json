        "Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook shrimp for 2 minutes per side until opaque. Remove shrimp and keep warm.",

        "Incorporate Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes. Cook for 2 minutes to release the herbs' aroma.",
        "Lower heat and allow the skillet to cool slightly until simmering ceases. Stir in butter until fully melted and emulsified with the sauce.",
