    "ingredients": [
        "1 lb chicken breast, diced",
        "2 tablespoons Kerrygold butter",
        "1 cup chicken broth",
        "1 cup heavy cream",
        "2 cups broccoli florets",
        "1 teaspoon garlic powder",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "1 cup cooked pasta (optional)",
        "Fresh parsley for garnish"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Start by melting Kerrygold butter in a large pot over medium heat. It's gonna smell SO good!",
        "Add the diced chicken and season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Cook until browned, about 5-7 minutes.",
        "Pour in the chicken broth and bring it to a gentle simmer. Let it bubble for about 10 minutes to soak up all those flavors.",
        "Stir in the heavy cream and broccoli florets. Cook for another 5-7 minutes until the broccoli is tender and the sauce is creamy.",
        "If you wanna make it heartier, toss in the cooked pasta now and stir until everything is well mixed.",
        "Garnish with fresh parsley before serving. Seriously, you’re gonna love how it looks!"
    ],
    "tips": "When it comes to cooking chicken, make sure it’s cut into even pieces so everything cooks evenly. I always check the internal temp – it should hit 165°F. If you want to spice things up, add some red pepper flakes for a kick. And don’t forget, leftovers taste even better the next day! Store any extras in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stove, adding a splash of broth if it’s too thick. Pro tip: If your sauce is too thin, let it simmer a bit longer to thicken up. Trust me, you’ll want that creamy goodness!",
