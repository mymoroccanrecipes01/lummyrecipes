    "ingredients": [
        "4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts",
        "1 cup heavy cream",
        "1 cup chicken broth",
        "1 cup sun-dried tomatoes, chopped",
        "1 cup spinach, fresh or frozen",
        "1 teaspoon garlic powder",
        "1 teaspoon Italian seasoning",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "1 tablespoon olive oil",
        "Fresh basil for garnish"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Season the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning.",
        "Sear the chicken for about 5-7 minutes on each side until golden brown. Remove from skillet and set aside.",
        "In the same skillet, add chicken broth and bring to a simmer. Stir in the heavy cream and sun-dried tomatoes, mixing well.",
        "Return the chicken to the skillet, cover, and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce thickens.",
        "Add spinach in the last 5 minutes of cooking, allowing it to wilt. Adjust seasoning if needed.",
        "Serve hot, garnished with fresh basil."
    ],
    "tips": "To ensure your chicken remains juicy, avoid overcooking it; use a meat thermometer to check for an internal temperature of 165°F. When selecting sun-dried tomatoes, opt for those packed in oil for added flavor. If using frozen spinach, make sure to thaw and drain it well to prevent excess moisture in the dish. For storage, keep leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stove or in the microwave, adding a splash of broth if the sauce thickens too much.",

Searing them first adds a beautiful golden crust.</li><li><strong>Key seasonings/aromatics:</strong> Garlic powder and Italian seasoning are essential for building depth in flavor. They enhance the dish's aroma and complement the creaminess of the sauce beautifully.</li><li><strong>Supporting ingredients:</strong> Sun-dried tomatoes add a burst of tangy sweetness, while spinach contributes color and nutritional value. Both ingredients elevate the dish's visual appeal and taste.</li><li><strong>Smart substitutions:</strong> For a lighter version, use chicken thighs instead of breasts, or substitute heavy cream with coconut milk for a dairy-free option. Both will alter the flavor profile slightly but still yield delicious results.</li><li><strong>Equipment needed:</strong> A large skillet is essential for searing the chicken and simmering the sauce, while a meat thermometer ensures perfectly cooked chicken every time.</li></ul></p>"
