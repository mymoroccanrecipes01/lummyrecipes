    "ingredients": [
        "1 pound fresh green beans, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces",
        "1 can (10.5 oz) cream of mushroom soup, condensed",
        "1/2 cup milk",
        "1 cup crispy fried onions, divided",
        "1 teaspoon garlic powder",
        "Salt and pepper to taste"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Prepare a baking dish by lightly greasing it.",
        "In a large pot, bring salted water to a boil and blanch the green beans for about 5 minutes until bright green and slightly tender. Drain and set aside.",
        "In a mixing bowl, combine the cream of mushroom soup, milk, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Stir until well blended.",
        "Add the blanched green beans to the soup mixture and half of the crispy fried onions. Mix until the beans are evenly coated.",
        "Transfer the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.",
        "Remove from the oven, sprinkle the remaining fried onions on top, and return to the oven for an additional 10 minutes until bubbly and golden."
    ],
    "tips": "To ensure your green beans maintain their vibrant color, blanch them for just a few minutes before mixing them with the sauce. Choose fresh green beans for the best texture; look for ones that are firm and bright green. Avoid overcooking during the blanching step to keep them crisp. If you have leftovers, store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 15 minutes or until warmed through. For a richer flavor, consider adding a sprinkle of parmesan cheese before baking.",
