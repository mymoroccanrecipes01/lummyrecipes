    "ingredients": [
        "6 large eggs, hard-boiled and peeled",
        "3 tablespoons mayonnaise",
        "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard",
        "1 teaspoon white vinegar",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "Paprika for garnish",
        "Fresh chives, chopped (optional)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Begin by placing the hard-boiled eggs in a pot of cold water. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then cover and remove from heat. Let them sit for 10 minutes before transferring to an ice bath to cool.",
        "Once cooled, peel the eggs and slice them in half lengthwise. Carefully scoop out the yolks into a mixing bowl, placing the whites on a serving platter.",
        "Mash the yolks with a fork, then mix in the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, white vinegar, salt, and pepper until smooth and creamy.",
        "Spoon or pipe the yolk mixture back into the egg whites, filling each half generously.",
        "Sprinkle the tops with paprika for a touch of color and flavor. Optionally, garnish with chopped chives for added freshness.",
        "Serve immediately or refrigerate until ready to enjoy."
    ],
    "tips": "To ensure perfectly hard-boiled eggs, start with eggs that are at least a week old; they peel more easily. When boiling, avoid overcooking to prevent a greenish ring around the yolk. For a creamier filling, consider using Greek yogurt in place of some mayonnaise. If you're preparing ahead, store the filled eggs in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to two days. For a flavor twist, try adding a dash of hot sauce or a sprinkle of curry powder to the yolk mixture.",
