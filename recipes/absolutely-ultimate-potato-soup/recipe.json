    "ingredients": [
        "1 pound bacon, chopped",
        "2 stalks celery, diced",
        "1 onion, chopped",
        "3 cloves garlic, minced",
        "8 potatoes, peeled and cubed",
        "4 cups chicken stock, or enough to cover potatoes",
        "3 tablespoons butter",
        "¼ cup all-purpose flour",
        "1 cup heavy cream",
        "1 teaspoon dried tarragon",
        "3 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro",
        "salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Place bacon in a Dutch oven and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, 5 to 10 minutes.",
        "Drain bacon pieces on paper towels and drain off all but 1\/4 cup of the bacon grease.",
        "Cook celery and onion in the reserved bacon drippings until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.",
        "Stir in garlic and continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes.",
        "Add cubed potatoes and toss to coat. Sauté for 3 to 4 minutes.",
        "Return bacon to the pan and add enough chicken stock to just cover the potatoes.",
        "Cover and simmer until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, melt butter in a separate skillet over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook, stirring constantly, 1 to 2 minutes.",
        "Whisk in heavy cream, tarragon, and cilantro.",
        "Bring cream mixture to a boil and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes.",
        "Add cream mixture to the potato mixture and stir to combine.",
        "Transfer about half of the soup to a blender and purée, then return to the Dutch oven.",
        "Adjust seasonings with salt and pepper to taste.",
        "Serve hot and enjoy!"
    ],
    "tips": "For a bacon-free version, substitute 1\/4 cup melted butter for the bacon grease. Use a sturdy blender to purée the soup smoothly, and don’t overcook the potatoes to keep a pleasant texture. Garnish with crispy bacon bits, fresh green onions, or shredded Cheddar for extra flavor and texture.",
