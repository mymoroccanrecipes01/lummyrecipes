    "ingredients": [
        "4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts",
        "1 cup heavy cream",
        "1 tablespoon olive oil",
        "2 cloves garlic, minced",
        "1 teaspoon dried thyme",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "1\/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese",
        "Fresh parsley for garnish"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Begin by heating olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper, then add them to the skillet. Cook for about 6-7 minutes on each side until they are golden brown and cooked through.",
        "Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the skillet and set aside. In the same skillet, add minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant.",
        "Pour in the heavy cream and bring it to a gentle simmer. Stir in the dried thyme and grated Parmesan cheese, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly for about 3-4 minutes.",
        "Return the chicken to the skillet, coating it well with the creamy sauce. Let it simmer for an additional 2-3 minutes to absorb the flavors.",
        "Serve the chicken hot, garnished with fresh parsley for a pop of color and flavor."
    ],
    "tips": "To ensure your chicken breasts remain juicy, avoid overcooking them. Use a meat thermometer to check for an internal temperature of 165°F. For a richer flavor, consider adding a splash of white wine to the sauce after sautéing the garlic. If you prefer a lighter version, substitute the heavy cream with half-and-half or a plant-based cream. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop over low heat to maintain the creamy texture.",
