    "ingredients": [
        "1 pound shrimp peeled and deveined",
        "1 tablespoon olive oil",
        "4 garlic cloves minced",
        "1.5 cups dry white wine",
        "Juice of one lime",
        "1 teaspoon Italian seasoning",
        "0.5 teaspoon red pepper flakes",
        "6 tablespoons butter",
        "2 tablespoons fresh parsley chopped",
        "0.5 cup grated Parmesan cheese",
        "Salt and pepper to taste"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place the shrimp in a single layer and cook for about two minutes on each side until they turn pink and opaque. Remove the shrimp and set aside, keeping them warm.",
        "In the same skillet, add the minced garlic. Cook the garlic just 30 seconds until fragrant being careful not to burn it. If the pan feels dry, add a splash more olive oil.",
        "Pour in the white wine and fresh lime juice. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil and let it reduce until the liquid has halved in volume.",
        "Sprinkle in the Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes. Let the sauce simmer for a couple of minutes so the herbs and spice release their aromas and meld with the wine reduction.",
        "Turn the heat down to low. When the sauce stops bubbling, add the butter in pieces. Allow it to melt slowly while stirring so it emulsifies into a smooth, silky sauce.",
        "Return the shrimp along with any juices back to the skillet. Stir in the fresh parsley and grated Parmesan cheese. Warm everything together for a minute until heated through and the cheese partly melts. Serve immediately while hot."

    "tips": "Always dry your shrimp thoroughly with paper towels before cooking so you get that perfect sear instead of steaming. Adding the butter off the heat or low temperature helps the sauce stay silky without breaking. If your wine is very acidic, balance with a teaspoon of sugar or a touch more butter.",
