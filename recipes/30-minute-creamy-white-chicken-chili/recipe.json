    "ingredients": [
        "1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast, diced",
        "1 can (15 oz) white beans, drained and rinsed",
        "1 cup chicken broth (Kerrygold works well)",
        "1 cup heavy cream (or half-and-half for a lighter option)",
        "1 cup corn, frozen or fresh",
        "1 onion, diced",
        "2 cloves garlic, minced",
        "1 teaspoon chili powder",
        "1 teaspoon cumin",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "Chopped cilantro for garnish (optional)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "In a large pot, heat a drizzle of oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Throw in the garlic and stir for another minute.",
        "Add the diced chicken to the pot and season with salt, pepper, chili powder, and cumin. Cook until the chicken is no longer pink, roughly 5-7 minutes.",
        "Stir in the beans, corn, and chicken broth. Bring to a gentle simmer and let it cook for about 10 minutes so the flavors meld together.",
        "Now, pour in the heavy cream, stirring continuously until the chili is creamy and heated through. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.",
        "Serve hot, topped with fresh cilantro if desired. Enjoy your cozy bowl!"
    ],
    "tips": "So, here are a few things I’ve learned from my chili-making adventures. First off, don’t skimp on the spices! They’re essential for flavor. I usually add a bit more chili powder if I want a kick. Also, if you want to prep ahead, chop your onions and garlic earlier in the day. It saves time! My neighbor Susan always says, 'The secret to creamy chili is the cream!' She’s right. And if you find it too thick, just add a splash more broth. Lastly, leftovers taste even better the next day, so don’t hesitate to double the recipe!",

Just last week, my son said, 'Can we have this again, Mom?' High praise from my little food critic!<\/p>"

            "content": "<p><strong>Main ingredient (protein\/base):<\/strong> Chicken breast is my go-to here because it cooks quickly and stays tender in the chili. Always look for fresh, high-quality chicken to ensure the best flavor.<\/p><p><strong>Key seasonings\/aromatics:<\/strong> Garlic and onions are crucial for building that base flavor. I usually opt for fresh garlic because it’s more aromatic. Kerrygold butter is what I use to sauté them for an extra rich flavor.<\/p><p><strong>Supporting ingredients:<\/strong> White beans add creaminess and protein, while corn gives a nice sweetness to balance the spices. I love using frozen corn because it’s always sweet and convenient.<\/p><p><strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> If you’re out of chicken, turkey works just as well. You can also use vegetable broth and skip the cream for a lighter option. And if you want a kick, add some diced jalapeños!<\/p><p><strong>Equipment needed:<\/strong> A sturdy pot is key for even cooking. I use my KitchenAid pot because it heats evenly and looks great on my stovetop.<\/p>"

I usually add about a teaspoon.<\/p><p><strong>Upgrades:<\/strong> For a creamy version, try adding some cream cheese while it simmers. It makes the chili richer without much effort!<\/p><p><strong>Technique variations:<\/strong> You can try this in a slow cooker if you have time.
