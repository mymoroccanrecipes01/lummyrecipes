        "1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, diced",
        "1 tablespoon olive oil",
        "1 medium onion, chopped",
        "2 cloves garlic, minced",
        "1 can (15 ounces) white beans, drained and rinsed",
        "1 can (14.5 ounces) diced tomatoes with green chilies",
        "2 cups chicken broth",
        "1 teaspoon ground cumin",

        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "Fresh cilantro for garnish"

    "instructions": [
        "In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent, about 3-4 minutes.",
        "Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute until fragrant.",
        "Add the diced chicken to the pot, cooking until browned on all sides, approximately 5-7 minutes.",

    "tips": "To elevate your chicken chili, consider these professional tips: \n- For a deeper flavor, sear the chicken until golden brown before adding other ingredients. This caramelization enhances the dish's richness. \n- When selecting chicken, opt for organic or free-range for better taste and texture. Always check for freshness and avoid any signs of discoloration. \n- A common mistake is overcooking the chicken, which can make it tough. Aim for just cooked through, and it will remain tender. \n- Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stove to maintain creaminess. \n- For optimal flavor, let the chili sit for a few minutes before serving, allowing the spices to meld beautifully.",
