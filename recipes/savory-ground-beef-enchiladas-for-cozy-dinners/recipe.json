    "ingredients": [
        "1 pound ground beef",
        "1 can (10 oz) enchilada sauce",
        "8 corn tortillas",
        "1 cup shredded cheese (cheddar or Mexican blend)",
        "1\/2 cup diced onion",
        "1 teaspoon garlic powder",
        "1 teaspoon cumin",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "Fresh cilantro for garnish (optional)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).",
        "In a skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef with diced onion until browned, about 5-7 minutes. Drain excess fat.",
        "Stir in garlic powder, cumin, salt, and pepper, mixing well. Pour in half of the enchilada sauce and stir until combined.",
        "Warm the tortillas in a dry skillet or microwave until pliable. Fill each tortilla with the beef mixture and a sprinkle of cheese, then roll them up tightly.",

    "tips": "One key technique is to warm the tortillas before filling them; this prevents them from cracking. A common mistake is overfilling the tortillas, which makes them hard to roll. If you have leftovers, they reheat beautifully in the oven or microwave. You can also swap the ground beef for shredded chicken or beans for a vegetarian option.",
