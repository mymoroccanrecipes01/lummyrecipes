        "Bake for about 30 minutes, or until the internal temperature hits 160°F. Honestly, it’ll smell amazing while cooking!",
        "Meanwhile, place the quartered potatoes in a pot of cold salted water. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 15-20 minutes. You’ll know they’re done when you can easily pierce them with a fork.",
        "Drain the potatoes and return them to the pot. Add in the milk and butter, then mash until creamy. Season with salt and pepper to your liking. Serve alongside the meatloaf."

    "tips": "When making meatloaf, consider these tips: \n1. Use a 50\/50 mix of ground beef and pork for added flavor. It’s a game changer! \n2. Let the meatloaf rest for a few minutes before slicing to keep it juicy. \n3. You can throw in some chopped veggies like bell peppers or carrots for extra nutrients. Just make sure they’re finely chopped so they blend well. \n4. For mashed potatoes, use a potato ricer for the fluffiest texture (my secret weapon). \n5. If you have leftovers, meatloaf sandwiches the next day are the bomb!",

Ground turkey works too, but it’ll be a tad drier. <strong>Key seasonings\/aromatics:<\/strong> Onion and garlic powder are crucial for that classic flavor. I always use fresh onions because they bring a sweetness that dried just can’t match. <strong>Supporting ingredients:<\/strong> Breadcrumbs help bind everything and keep it moist. If you’re out, crushed crackers can work in a pinch. <strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> You can swap ground beef for turkey or even use lentils for a veggie version.
