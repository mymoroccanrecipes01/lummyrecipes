        "1 pound ground beef",
        "1 cup breadcrumbs",
        "1\/2 cup milk",
        "1\/4 cup finely chopped onion",
        "1\/4 cup ketchup",
        "1 large egg",

        "1 teaspoon salt",
        "1\/2 teaspoon black pepper",
        "1\/2 teaspoon garlic powder",

        "1\/2 cup heavy cream",
        "4 tablespoons butter",
        "Salt and pepper to taste"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, breadcrumbs, milk, onion, ketchup, egg, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Mix until well combined.",
        "Shape the mixture into a loaf and place it in a greased baking dish. Spread a thin layer of ketchup on top for added flavor.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven for about 60 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 160°F (70°C). Let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing.",
        "Meanwhile, boil the cubed potatoes in salted water until tender, about 15-20 minutes. Drain and return them to the pot.",
        "Add the heavy cream and butter to the potatoes, then mash until smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
        "Serve slices of meatloaf alongside a generous scoop of creamy mashed potatoes."
    ],
    "tips": "To ensure your meatloaf is moist, avoid overmixing the meat mixture. Use fresh breadcrumbs for better texture, and consider adding chopped herbs for extra flavor. When mashing potatoes, warm the cream and butter slightly to help them blend smoothly. For storage, keep leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven at 350°F (175°C) until warmed through, about 20 minutes. Always check the internal temperature of the meatloaf to avoid undercooking.",
