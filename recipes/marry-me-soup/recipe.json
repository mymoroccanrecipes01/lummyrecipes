    "ingredients": [
        "1 tablespoon olive oil",
        "1 medium onion, finely chopped",
        "2 cloves garlic, minced",
        "3 cups vegetable broth",
        "1 cup heavy cream",
        "1 cup diced potatoes",
        "1 cup carrots, sliced",
        "1 teaspoon dried thyme",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "Fresh parsley for garnish"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes.",
        "Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute until fragrant.",
        "Pour in the vegetable broth, then add the diced potatoes and sliced carrots. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and let it simmer for 15 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.",
        "Once the vegetables are cooked, stir in the heavy cream and dried thyme. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and let it simmer for another 5 minutes.",
        "Remove from heat and garnish with fresh parsley before serving."
    ],
    "tips": "To elevate your Marry Me Soup, consider these professional tips: \n- Use fresh herbs instead of dried for a brighter flavor. Add them towards the end of cooking to preserve their aroma. \n- Avoid overcooking the vegetables; they should be tender but still hold their shape for texture. \n- For a thicker soup, blend a portion of it and return it to the pot. This adds creaminess without needing more cream. \n- Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stove to maintain the creamy texture. \n- If you want to make it ahead, prepare the soup without cream and add it just before serving for the best results.",

Heavy cream is preferred for its luxurious mouthfeel, but you can substitute with half-and-half for a lighter option. Just remember that the creaminess is key to the dish's appeal.</p><p><strong>Key seasonings/aromatics:</strong> Onions and garlic are foundational for building flavor. They add depth and sweetness, especially when sautéed until golden. Fresh herbs like thyme can elevate the dish, adding a fragrant note that complements the cream.</p><p><strong>Supporting ingredients:</strong> Potatoes and carrots contribute to the soup's heartiness, providing texture and natural sweetness. Make sure to cut them into uniform pieces for even cooking.</p><p><strong>Smart substitutions:</strong> If you're looking for alternatives, consider using coconut milk for a dairy-free version, or add cooked chicken for extra protein. Both options will change the flavor profile but still create a delicious soup.</p><p><strong>Equipment needed:</strong> A large pot is essential for cooking the soup evenly. A sharp knife and cutting board will make your prep work easier, ensuring all ingredients are chopped uniformly.</p>"
