    "tips": "When making these bites, ensure your cream cheese is at room temperature for easier mixing. A common mistake is overmixing the whipped cream, which can make the bites dense. You can substitute the freeze-dried strawberries with other fruits like raspberries or blueberries for a different flavor. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to three days.",
