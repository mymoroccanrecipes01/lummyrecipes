    "ingredients": [
        "1 cup freeze-dried strawberries, crushed",
        "1 package golden Oreos, finely crushed",
        "8 oz cream cheese, softened (I like using Organic Valley)",
        "1\/4 cup powdered sugar",
        "1 tsp vanilla extract",
        "1\/2 cup whipped cream (homemade or store-bought)",
        "Chocolate drizzle for topping (optional)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "In a mixing bowl, combine the softened cream cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract. Mix until smooth and creamy. You can use a KitchenAid mixer if you have one – makes it super easy!",
        "Gently fold in the whipped cream until fully combined. The mixture should be light and fluffy.",
        "Now, add the crushed freeze-dried strawberries and golden Oreos to the cream cheese mixture. Stir until everything is well blended. The colors will be so vibrant!",
        "Using a small scoop or your hands, form the mixture into bite-sized balls and place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet.",
        "If you're feeling fancy, drizzle some melted chocolate over the top of the bites. Chill in the fridge for about 30 minutes to set. That's it!"
    ],
    "tips": "OK, so here are some pro tips for these bites: \n\n1. Use room temperature cream cheese – trust me, it makes mixing so much easier and smoother. \n\n2. For the best flavor, try adding a little lemon zest to the cream cheese mixture. It brightens everything up! \n\n3. Keep the bites stored in an airtight container in the fridge. They’ll stay fresh for about 3 days, but good luck keeping them around that long. \n\n4. If you want to make these gluten-free, swap the Oreos for a gluten-free cookie option. I’ve tried it with Bob's Red Mill gluten-free cookies and it worked great! \n\n5. Lastly, if you have any leftovers (which I doubt), freeze them. They thaw out nicely and make for a quick sweet treat later!",

Lisa said, 'You HAVE to try these – they're my new obsession!' I took a bite and was blown away by the creamy filling and crunch. Since then, I’ve been making them for every summer party.

Look for a good quality brand like Organic Valley, as it really enhances the flavor. Let it sit out until it’s soft – this is crucial for mixing!<br\/><strong>Key seasonings\/aromatics:<\/strong> The vanilla extract adds a comforting sweetness and depth to the bites. Always use pure vanilla (the fake stuff just doesn’t cut it!).<br\/><strong>Supporting ingredients:<\/strong> Freeze-dried strawberries are the star! They bring that fruity punch without adding moisture. You can find them at Whole Foods or online. They need to be crushed finely for even distribution.<br\/><strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> If you can't find freeze-dried strawberries, fresh strawberries work too, but you'll need to adjust for the moisture. Also, you can swap Oreos with any cookie you like – I’ve tried it with graham crackers and it’s delicious!<br\/><strong>Equipment needed:<\/strong> A good mixing bowl and a KitchenAid mixer are game-changers for this recipe. They help achieve that perfect creamy texture!<\/p>"
