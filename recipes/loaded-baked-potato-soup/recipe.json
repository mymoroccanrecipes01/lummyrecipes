    "ingredients": [
        "4 large russet potatoes, peeled and diced",
        "1 medium onion, finely chopped",
        "3 cloves garlic, minced",
        "4 cups chicken or vegetable broth",
        "1 cup heavy cream",
        "1 cup shredded cheddar cheese, plus extra for topping",
        "1/2 cup cooked bacon, crumbled",
        "2 tablespoons olive oil",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "Chopped green onions for garnish"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "In a large pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute until fragrant.",
        "Add the diced potatoes to the pot, followed by the broth. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.",
        "Once the potatoes are cooked, use an immersion blender to puree the soup until smooth. If you prefer a chunkier texture, blend only half of the soup.",
        "Stir in the heavy cream and shredded cheddar cheese, mixing until the cheese is melted and the soup is creamy. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
        "Ladle the soup into bowls and top with crumbled bacon, additional cheese, and chopped green onions before serving."
    ],
    "tips": "To achieve the best flavor, choose starchy potatoes like russets, as they create a creamier texture when blended. Be careful not to overcook the garlic, as it can become bitter. If you want to make this soup ahead of time, prepare it without the cream and cheese, then add them just before serving to maintain the best texture. For reheating, warm the soup gently on the stove over low heat, stirring frequently to prevent sticking. If the soup thickens too much, add a splash of broth or water to reach your desired consistency.",

Dice them evenly for consistent cooking.</li><li><strong>Key seasonings/aromatics:</strong> Onions and garlic are essential for building flavor. Sauté them until soft to release their natural sweetness, enhancing the overall taste of the soup.</li><li><strong>Supporting ingredients:</strong> Heavy cream adds richness, while cheddar cheese contributes a savory depth. For a lighter version, consider using half-and-half or a dairy-free alternative.</li><li><strong>Smart substitutions:</strong> For a lighter soup, swap heavy cream for coconut milk, which adds a subtle sweetness. Alternatively, use Greek yogurt for a tangy twist without sacrificing creaminess.</li><li><strong>Equipment needed:</strong> A large pot is crucial for cooking the soup evenly, while an immersion blender makes it easy to achieve a smooth consistency without transferring to a blender.</li></ul></p>"

Use a thermometer if necessary to ensure your broth is at a simmer, not a rolling boil.</li><li><strong>Common mistake to avoid:</strong> A frequent error is overcooking the garlic, which can ruin the soup's flavor. Always add garlic after the onions have softened.</li><li><strong>Perfect doneness indicator:</strong> The potatoes should be fork-tender, meaning they easily break apart when pierced. This texture is crucial for a smooth soup.</li><li><strong>Storage & reheating:</strong> Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stove, adding a splash of broth if the soup thickens.</li></ul>"
