    "ingredients": [
        "4 chicken breasts, boneless and skinless",
        "2 tablespoons olive oil",
        "1 teaspoon garlic powder",
        "1 teaspoon onion powder",
        "1 teaspoon paprika",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped for garnish"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Begin by preheating your oven to 400°F (200°C). While it heats, pat the chicken breasts dry with paper towels to ensure a nice sear.",
        "In a small bowl, mix together the garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. Rub this spice blend evenly over both sides of the chicken breasts.",
        "Heat the olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the chicken breasts and sear for about 5 minutes on each side until they are golden brown.",
        "Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (75°C).",
        "Remove the skillet from the oven, let the chicken rest for a few minutes, then slice and garnish with fresh parsley before serving."

    "tips": "To ensure your chicken remains juicy, avoid overcooking it. Use a meat thermometer to check for doneness. For added flavor, marinate the chicken in the spice blend for a few hours before cooking. If you have leftovers, store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat gently in the microwave or on the stovetop to maintain tenderness. When selecting chicken, look for breasts that are plump and have a pinkish hue without any discoloration.",
