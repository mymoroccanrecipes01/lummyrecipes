    "ingredients": [
        "1 cup cooked chicken, shredded (I use rotisserie for ease)",
        "1\/2 cup black beans, rinsed and drained",
        "1\/2 cup corn, frozen or canned",
        "1\/2 cup shredded cheese (I love Kerrygold cheddar)",
        "1\/4 cup diced red bell pepper",
        "1\/4 cup diced green onions",
        "1 teaspoon chili powder",
        "1\/2 teaspoon cumin",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "1 package eggroll wrappers (found in the freezer section)",
        "Oil for frying (canola or vegetable works great)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "First off, heat up some oil in a deep pan over medium heat. You want it hot but not smoking, you know?",
        "In a mixing bowl, combine shredded chicken, black beans, corn, cheese, red bell pepper, green onions, chili powder, cumin, and season with salt and pepper. Mix it all together. Seriously, it smells so good.",
        "Now, grab an eggroll wrapper and place about 2 tablespoons of filling in the center. Fold the edges over and roll it tightly. You might wanna seal the edges with a little water.",
        "Fry those bad boys in the hot oil for about 3-4 minutes on each side until they’re golden brown. Keep an eye on them - nobody wants a burned eggroll, right?",
        "Once they’re cooked, place them on a paper towel to soak up any excess oil. Let them cool for a minute before serving."
    ],
    "tips": "When it comes to frying, you may wanna do it in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan. If you’re not into frying, these can also be baked! Preheat your oven to 425°F and place them on a baking sheet with a little oil spray. Bake for about 20 minutes, flipping halfway through. Trust me, they’ll still be crispy. If you want to spice things up, add some jalapeños or taco seasoning to the filling. And don’t forget the dipping sauce – a simple avocado or ranch dressing works wonders! Oh, and if you have leftovers (which is rare), store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat them in the oven for a crispy finish.",

My husband literally requests them every month and says, \"Babe, these are the best!\"<\/p>"

Make sure it’s seasoned well, or you’ll miss that flavor punch. <strong>Key seasonings\/aromatics:<\/strong> Chili powder and cumin are my go-tos for a southwest kick. Try using brands like McCormick for consistent flavor. <strong>Supporting ingredients:<\/strong> Black beans and corn add texture and moisture. Rinsing the beans helps remove excess sodium, giving you a cleaner taste. <strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> If you’re out of chicken, you can swap in shredded beef or even tofu for a vegetarian option. Just make sure to adjust the spices accordingly! <strong>Equipment needed:<\/strong> You’ll need a deep frying pan or a Dutch oven for frying. My KitchenAid deep fryer is a game changer for frying evenly.<\/p>"
