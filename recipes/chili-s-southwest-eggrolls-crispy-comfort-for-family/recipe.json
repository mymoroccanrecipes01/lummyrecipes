    "ingredients": [
        "1 cup shredded cooked chicken",
        "1 cup black beans, rinsed and drained",
        "1 cup corn kernels, fresh or frozen",
        "1 cup shredded cheese (cheddar or Mexican blend)",
        "1/2 cup diced red bell pepper",
        "1/4 cup chopped green onions",
        "1 teaspoon ground cumin",
        "1 teaspoon chili powder",
        "1/2 teaspoon garlic powder",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "8 eggroll wrappers",
        "Oil for frying"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "In a large bowl, combine the shredded chicken, black beans, corn, cheese, red bell pepper, and green onions. Mix well.",
        "Add cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper to the mixture and stir until evenly distributed.",
        "Place an eggroll wrapper on a clean surface, spoon about 2 tablespoons of the filling onto the center, and roll tightly, sealing the edges with a little water.",
        "Heat oil in a deep skillet over medium heat. Once hot, carefully add the eggrolls, frying until golden brown and crispy, about 3-4 minutes per side.",
        "Remove the eggrolls and drain on paper towels to absorb excess oil.",
        "Serve warm with your favorite dipping sauce."
    ],
    "tips": "To ensure your eggrolls are crispy, make sure the oil is hot enough before frying; test with a small piece of wrapper. For a healthier version, consider baking the eggrolls at 400°F for 15-20 minutes, flipping halfway through. If you're short on time, pre-cooked rotisserie chicken works great as a filling. Avoid overfilling the wrappers to prevent them from bursting during frying. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days, and reheat in the oven for best results.",
