    "ingredients": [
        "4 cups mixed greens (like spinach and arugula)",
        "2 medium oranges, peeled and segmented",
        "1\/2 cup pecans, roughly chopped",
        "1\/4 cup crumbled feta cheese",

    "instructions": [
        "OK so first, grab a large salad bowl and toss in those mixed greens. You want a good base, you know?",
        "Next, add in the orange segments. Seriously, those juicy bites are what make this salad pop.",
        "Now sprinkle the chopped pecans and crumbled feta on top. The crunch and creaminess? So good!",
        "In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Drizzle that over the salad. I said drizzle, but you might wanna pour it on if you're feeling wild.",
        "Finish with a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Toss everything gently, but don't go crazy - you want those oranges to stay pretty."
    ],
    "tips": "Alright, let’s talk tips. First, when choosing oranges, go for ones that feel heavy for their size - they tend to be juicier. And if you can, use Kerrygold butter for those pecans if you’re toasting them; it adds a nice richness. Speaking of pecans, if you roast them for about 5-7 minutes at 350°F, they’ll bring out a deeper flavor. My KitchenAid mixer comes in handy for whisking those dressings quickly, trust me. Lastly, this salad is best served fresh, but if you have leftovers, keep the dressing separate to avoid sogginess. It should last in the fridge for about 2 days.",

When shopping, look for vibrant-colored greens that aren’t wilting. I usually wash and dry them before making the salad to keep it crisp.<br\/><strong>Key seasonings:<\/strong> Olive oil and balsamic vinegar create a simple yet flavorful dressing. I prefer high-quality olive oil for the best taste. It really enhances the freshness of the salad.<br\/><strong>Supporting ingredients:<\/strong> Pecans add crunch and richness. You can toast them for a deeper flavor, which I totally recommend!<br\/><strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> If you don't have pecans, walnuts or almonds work great too. And for a vegan version, skip the feta or use a dairy-free alternative.<br\/><strong>Equipment needed:<\/strong> A large mixing bowl is essential for tossing everything together. I also use my KitchenAid for whisking the dressing quickly.<\/p>"
