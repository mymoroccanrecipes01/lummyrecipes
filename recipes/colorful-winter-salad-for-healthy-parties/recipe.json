Look for crisp leaves without browning. \n- Toasting pecans enhances their nuttiness; do this in a dry skillet over medium heat for 5-7 minutes, stirring frequently to avoid burning. \n- Avoid over-dressing your salad; start with a small amount of dressing and add more as needed to keep the greens crisp. \n- For meal prep, keep the dressing separate until just before serving to maintain the salad's freshness. \n- Experiment with seasonal fruits like pomegranate or apples for a twist on flavor and color.",

Look for a variety that includes arugula, spinach, and romaine for a mix of flavors. Wash and dry them thoroughly to avoid sogginess. <strong>Key seasonings\/aromatics:<\/strong> The dressing, made with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, adds a tangy richness that enhances the salad's natural sweetness. Use high-quality olive oil for the best flavor. <strong>Supporting ingredients:<\/strong> Oranges add sweetness and juiciness, while pecans contribute a satisfying crunch. Both ingredients brighten the dish visually and flavor-wise. <strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> Swap pecans for walnuts for a different nutty flavor, or use goat cheese instead of feta for a creamier texture. <strong>Equipment needed:<\/strong> A large mixing bowl is essential for combining the ingredients, and a whisk is perfect for emulsifying the dressing."
