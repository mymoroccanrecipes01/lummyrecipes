    "servings": 4,
    "ingredients": [
        "4 cups mixed greens (spinach and arugula, or similar)",
        "2 medium navel or Valencia oranges, peeled and segmented",
        "½ cup pecans, roughly chopped",
        "¼ cup crumbled feta cheese",
        "¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil",
        "2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar",
        "¼ teaspoon fine sea salt",
        "Fresh ground black pepper to taste"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Pat the mixed greens dry using paper towels or a salad spinner. Moisture is the enemy of crispness—any excess water will dilute the dressing and cause wilting. This step takes just 2-3 minutes and makes a measurable difference in texture. If your greens are especially wet, lay them on clean towels for a few minutes.",
        "Toast the pecans in a dry skillet over medium heat for 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until fragrant. You'll notice the kitchen fills with a warm, nutty aroma—that's when you know they're ready. This optional step concentrates their flavor and deepens the sweetness, but if you're short on time, skip it without penalty. Remove from heat immediately to prevent burning.",
        "Peel your oranges by cutting off the top and bottom, then slicing away the white pith in vertical strips, following the curve of the fruit. Over a small bowl to catch juice, segment the orange by slicing between the membranes. This takes about 3 minutes per orange. Reserve any juice that collects.",
        "Pour the olive oil and balsamic vinegar into a small bowl. Add ¼ teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Whisk for about 30 seconds until combined. The dressing should emulsify slightly and appear darker. Taste and adjust seasoning—the acidity should feel bright without overwhelming. The vinegar-to-oil ratio is intentionally lower than classic vinaigrettes because the citrus juice provides additional acid.",
        "Place the dried greens in a large bowl. Add the orange segments (and any reserved juice), toasted pecans, and crumbled feta. At this stage, don't add dressing yet. This prevents premature wilting and keeps you in control of flavor intensity.",
        "Pour the dressing over the salad and toss gently but thoroughly, using two forks or salad servers. You want every leaf coated and flavors distributed, but handle the orange segments carefully so they remain intact rather than breaking apart. The residual citrus juice and oil create a natural secondary dressing.",
        "Taste a bite. If it needs more salt, add a pinch—seasoning greens properly is essential since they don't naturally contain sodium. Adjust pepper as desired. Serve immediately while the greens are crisp and cold."
    ],
    "pro_tips": [
        "Choose oranges that feel heavy for their size—density indicates higher water content and better flavor concentration. Store-bought navel or Valencia oranges work reliably, though farmers market options in peak season (December-February) offer noticeably better results.",
        "For make-ahead situations, keep the greens, orange segments, pecans, and feta separate and store in airtight containers. Assemble no more than 15 minutes before serving to maintain crispness. The dressing can be made up to 3 days ahead.",
        "If you prefer a creamier salad, whisk a tablespoon of Dijon mustard into the dressing—it emulsifies the oil and vinegar while adding subtle depth. Start with half a tablespoon if mustard flavor isn't your preference.",
        "Feta can sometimes be overly salty, especially in blocks. Taste yours before adding additional salt to the dressing, since the cheese will contribute seasoning. Crumbled feta is usually milder than block feta.",
        "The pecans' flavor depends on roasting time. Aim for 4-5 minutes at medium heat—they should smell toasted but taste buttery, not bitter. Under-roasting leaves them pale and bland; over-roasting creates bitterness that's difficult to remedy."
    ],
    "common_mistakes": [
        "Wet greens create soggy salads within minutes. This happens because excess water dilutes the dressing and prevents oil from adhering to leaves. Always spin or pat greens completely dry. If you're washing whole bunches, do this well in advance and wrap in paper towels for the fridge.",
        "Skipping the orange segmentation and using sliced rounds instead seems faster but results in juice flooding the bowl. The membranes of whole segments contain the juice, keeping moisture separate from the greens. Segmenting takes an extra minute but fundamentally improves texture.",
        "Adding dressing too far in advance causes the greens to wilt and taste watered-down rather than vibrant. The acidity in vinegar (pH ~3) begins breaking down cell walls immediately. Dress the salad just before serving or immediately after—the difference is noticeable.",
        "Using low-quality olive oil or rancid oil undermines the entire dish since it's a central flavor component. Extra-virgin olive oil should smell fresh and slightly grassy. Store it in a dark bottle in a cool cabinet, as heat and light degrade its quality."
    ],
    "variations": [
        "Gluten-free variation: This salad is naturally gluten-free in all its components. Simply verify that any store-bought dressing is certified gluten-free if using one.",
        "Vegan adaptation: Replace feta with a high-quality vegan cheese (cashew-based versions work well), or omit cheese entirely and increase pecans to ⅔ cup for richer texture. The salad remains satisfying without dairy.",
        "Protein addition: Grilled chicken breast (¾ pound), pan-seared chickpeas (1 can, drained and seasoned), or cooked quinoa (1 cup) transforms this from a side into a light main course. Add protein at the table so diners can choose portion size.",
        "Mediterranean version: Stir in ¼ cup pitted Kalamata olives and 3 tablespoons chopped sun-dried tomatoes. These additions add briny depth and work particularly well if you're reducing feta to 2 tablespoons.",
        "Seasonal winter greens: Trade arugula for thinly sliced radicchio or add a handful of endive leaves. These heartier greens stand up to dressing better than spinach and offer pleasant bitterness that contrasts with citrus sweetness."

    "storage_and_reheating": {
        "refrigerator": "Store dressed salad in an airtight container for up to 24 hours, though quality diminishes after several hours. Undressed components will keep 2-3 days: greens in a sealed container lined with paper towels, orange segments in a glass container, pecans in an airtight jar, and feta wrapped tightly in plastic wrap.",
        "freezer": "Do not freeze this salad. Greens and oranges contain high water content and will become mushy upon thawing. Pecans can be frozen for up to 3 months if you want to prepare them ahead.",

    "faq": [
        {
            "question": "Can I make this salad ahead of time?",
            "answer": "Yes, but with caveats. Prepare greens, oranges, pecans, and feta in separate containers up to a day ahead. Assemble the final salad no more than 15 minutes before serving, and add dressing right before eating. This preserves the crispy texture that makes the salad appealing."
        },
        {
            "question": "Why does my salad get soggy so quickly?",
            "answer": "The most common cause is wet greens. Always pat or spin them completely dry before combining. Second cause is adding dressing too far in advance—the acidity breaks down cell walls and releases water. Dress just before serving for best results."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can I substitute the feta cheese?",
            "answer": "Absolutely. Goat cheese, ricotta, or vegan cheese all work well. For a dairy-free version, simply omit it or add extra pecans for richness. The salad remains delicious without cheese, though it loses creaminess."
        },
        {
            "question": "What's the best type of orange to use?",
            "answer": "Navel and Valencia oranges are most reliable year-round. Choose fruit that feels heavy relative to its size, indicating higher juice content. Avoid pre-peeled or sectioned oranges—they oxidize quickly and lose flavor."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can I use bottled salad dressing instead of making my own?",
            "answer": "You can, though homemade dressing better balances the salad's flavors. If using bottled, choose a simple vinaigrette rather than creamy options, which overpower the citrus and greens. Go lighter on quantity since commercial dressings are usually more concentrated."
        },
        {
            "question": "How long does this salad last in the fridge?",
            "answer": "An undressed, well-stored salad keeps 2-3 days. Once dressed, it's best eaten within a few hours. Store in an airtight container, and if greens wilt, don't eat them—that indicates bacterial growth has begun."
        }
    ],
    "why_this_recipe_works": "This salad succeeds because it balances four essential flavor and texture components that work together rather than compete. The bitter, peppery arugula and mild spinach provide structure and body. Navel oranges contribute bright acidity and natural sweetness that softens the greens' slight bitterness without added sugar. Toasted pecans deliver richness and crunch—textures that make eating pleasant. Feta adds creaminess and mild saltiness that ties everything together without heaviness. The vinaigrette is intentionally simple because the ingredients already carry complex flavors. This restraint is key: if you over-dress or add too many flavor elements, you mask the individual components' quality. The cooking science here is minimal (it's raw), but texture science is crucial—proper greens preparation and careful dressing timing preserve crispness throughout eating.",
    "introduction_content": "I've been making variations of this salad for nearly fifteen years, usually when I want something fresh and substantial without spending much time cooking. My first version came together one January when I had leftover greens, a bowl of just-segmented oranges from breakfast, and some pecans I'd toasted the previous evening. That casual combination taught me how powerful simplicity can be. The salad appeared regularly on winter menus after that—for holiday tables when I needed something light alongside rich main courses, for quick lunches when I was working from home, and for weeknight dinners when I wanted vegetables without effort. What makes this version worth returning to is how the flavors balance themselves. There's no hidden tricks or unusual ingredients. Just five simple components arranged thoughtfully. The result is a side dish that feels bright in the darkest months and works equally well as a light lunch when topped with grilled chicken.",
