    "ingredients": [
        "8 ounces dark chocolate, chopped",
        "8 ounces white chocolate, chopped",
        "1 teaspoon peppermint extract",
        "1\/2 cup crushed peppermint candies",
        "Pinch of sea salt"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Begin by melting the dark chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until smooth and fully melted.",
        "Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Pour the melted dark chocolate onto the sheet and spread it evenly to form a thin layer.",
        "In a separate bowl, melt the white chocolate using the same method. Once melted, stir in the peppermint extract for added flavor.",
        "Drizzle the white chocolate over the dark chocolate layer, creating a marbled effect. Use a toothpick to swirl them together gently.",
        "Sprinkle the crushed peppermint candies and a pinch of sea salt over the top. Allow the bark to set at room temperature for about 30 minutes or until firm.",
        "Once set, break the bark into pieces and enjoy or package it as a festive gift."
    ],
    "tips": "To ensure your chocolate melts smoothly, avoid overheating it. If you notice any lumps, stir vigorously until they dissolve. When selecting peppermint candies, opt for high-quality ones for the best flavor. Store any leftover bark in an airtight container at room temperature for up to two weeks. If you want to make the bark ahead of time, it can be frozen for up to a month. Just remember to wrap it tightly to prevent freezer burn. For a unique twist, consider adding a sprinkle of sea salt before the chocolate sets for a delightful contrast in flavor.",
