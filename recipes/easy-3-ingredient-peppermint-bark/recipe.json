    "ingredients": [
        "8 ounces dark chocolate, chopped",
        "8 ounces white chocolate, chopped",
        "1 teaspoon peppermint extract",
        "1/2 cup crushed peppermint candies or candy canes",
        "Pinch of sea salt for garnish"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Begin by melting the dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pot of simmering water, stirring until smooth and glossy. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.",
        "Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, then pour the melted dark chocolate onto the sheet, spreading it evenly with a spatula to form a thin layer.",
        "In a separate bowl, melt the white chocolate using the same method. Once melted, stir in the peppermint extract for a refreshing flavor.",
        "Pour the white chocolate over the dark chocolate layer, using a spatula to spread it evenly. While the chocolate is still warm, sprinkle the crushed peppermint candies on top, pressing them gently into the surface.",
        "Chill the bark in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes or until fully set. Once hardened, break it into pieces and sprinkle a pinch of sea salt over the top for an extra touch."
    ],
    "tips": "To ensure your chocolate melts smoothly, avoid any water getting into the bowl. Use high-quality chocolate for the best flavor and texture. If you want a stronger peppermint flavor, increase the peppermint extract slightly, but be cautious not to overpower the chocolate. Store the bark in an airtight container at room temperature for up to two weeks. For a festive touch, consider drizzling some melted chocolate over the top before adding the crushed candies.",

Look for high-quality chocolate with a cocoa content of at least 60% for the dark variety.

Opt for pure peppermint extract for the best taste, and add it to the melted white chocolate for a refreshing kick.</li><li><strong>Supporting ingredients:</strong> Crushed peppermint candies add a delightful crunch and visual appeal. Choose vibrant, fresh candy canes for the best color and flavor. You can also use chocolate sprinkles for a different texture.</li><li><strong>Smart substitutions:</strong> If you prefer a dairy-free option, use vegan chocolate chips. For a nutty twist, consider adding chopped nuts like almonds or pecans in place of some of the crushed candy.</li><li><strong>Equipment needed:</strong> A heatproof bowl for melting chocolate is essential, as well as a spatula for spreading. Parchment paper is crucial for easy removal and cleanup.</li></ul></p>"
