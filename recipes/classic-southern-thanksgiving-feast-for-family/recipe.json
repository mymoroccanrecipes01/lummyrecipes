    "ingredients": [
        "4 cups cornbread, crumbled (I use Bob's Red Mill mix for the best texture)",
        "2 cups vegetable broth, low-sodium",
        "1 cup onion, finely chopped",
        "1 cup celery, finely chopped",
        "1 teaspoon sage, dried (or fresh if you can find it)",
        "1 teaspoon thyme, dried",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "2 tablespoons Kerrygold butter",
        "3 cups sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed",
        "1\/4 cup brown sugar",
        "1\/4 cup maple syrup",
        "2 cups turkey gravy, homemade or store-bought"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Alright, first things first - preheat your oven to 350°F. While that’s heating up, let’s get your cornbread ready. If you’re using Bob's Red Mill, prepare it according to the package instructions. You want it slightly dry.",
        "Next, grab a skillet and melt the Kerrygold butter over medium heat. Toss in your chopped onion and celery. Sauté for about 5-7 minutes until they’re soft and fragrant. Seriously, the smell is gonna make your kitchen feel like home!",
        "Now, in a large bowl, combine the crumbled cornbread, sautéed veggies, sage, thyme, and enough vegetable broth to moisten everything. You want it to be moist but not soggy. Add salt and pepper to taste. It should feel like a warm hug.",
        "Spread that mixture into a greased baking dish and cover with foil. Bake for 25 minutes. Then remove the foil and bake for another 15-20 minutes until it gets a nice golden crust. That crunch on top? So good.",
        "While that’s baking, let’s tackle the sweet potatoes. Boil them in salted water until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and mash with brown sugar and maple syrup. You want them smooth but with a few chunks for texture. Trust me, this combo is a game changer!",
        "For the gravy, just heat it up in a saucepan until bubbling. Now, serve everything hot and watch it disappear faster than leftovers at a family gathering."
    ],
    "tips": "1. For the best cornbread texture, let it sit overnight before using it. It’ll soak up flavors better. 2. If you’re short on time, use store-bought gravy. Kerrygold butter adds richness, though! 3. You can prep the cornbread dressing a day ahead - just keep it covered in the fridge. 4. Don’t skip the foil during the first bake; it keeps moisture in. 5. Sweet potatoes can be made ahead too - just reheat them gently before serving.",
