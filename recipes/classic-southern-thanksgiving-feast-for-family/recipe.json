    "ingredients": [
        "1 batch of cornbread (made with Bob's Red Mill cornmeal)",
        "1 whole turkey (about 12-14 lbs)",
        "2 tablespoons Kerrygold butter",
        "4 cups collard greens, washed and chopped",
        "1 onion, diced",
        "4 cloves garlic, minced",
        "1 tablespoon olive oil",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "1 teaspoon smoked paprika",
        "2 cups chicken broth"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "OK, so first things first, preheat your oven to 325°F. While that's heating up, let's prep the turkey. Rinse it under cold water and pat it dry with paper towels. Season it generously with salt, pepper, and smoked paprika.",
        "Melt that Kerrygold butter in a roasting pan over medium heat. Sear the turkey breast side down for about 30 minutes. This gives it a nice golden color and locks in those juices.",
        "Flip the turkey and pour in 2 cups of chicken broth. Cover with foil and roast for about 2 hours. Check for doneness; it should reach 165°F in the thickest part. Trust me, you want to avoid undercooked turkey.",
        "While the turkey is roasting, heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the diced onion and sauté until translucent, then throw in the garlic and collard greens. Cook until the greens are wilted, about 10 minutes.",
        "Season the collards with salt and pepper, then add a splash of chicken broth if they seem dry. Let them simmer while the turkey finishes up. And don't forget to whip up that cornbread - easy peasy with Bob's Red Mill cornmeal."
    ],
    "tips": "Listen, cooking a turkey can be a bit daunting, but here’s what I’ve learned: 1) Always let your turkey rest for at least 20 minutes before carving. This helps keep it juicy. 2) If you want crispy skin, dry the turkey thoroughly before seasoning. 3) Collard greens can be prepped the day before; just reheat them in the pan. 4) For cornbread, I recommend using Kerrygold butter for richer flavor. 5) If you’re feeling adventurous, add some red pepper flakes to the collards for a spicy kick!",

It really makes a difference in taste and texture when cooked. <strong>Key seasonings:<\/strong> Salt and pepper are essential, but smoked paprika adds that depth you're gonna love. Brands like McCormick work great! <strong>Supporting ingredients:<\/strong> Collard greens add nutrients and a slightly bitter taste that balances the meal. When prepping, make sure to rinse them thoroughly. <strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> If you're short on time, you can use frozen collard greens, but fresh is always better. And for cornbread, any quality cornmeal will do, but I personally love Bob's Red Mill for its texture.<\/p>"
