    "ingredients": [
        "2 cups cooked chicken, shredded",
        "3 cups broccoli florets, chopped",
        "1 can (10.5 oz) cream of chicken soup",
        "1 cup sour cream",
        "1 cup shredded cheddar cheese (I use Kerrygold)",
        "1 teaspoon garlic powder",
        "1 teaspoon onion powder",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "2 cups cooked rice",
        "1\/2 cup breadcrumbs (optional for topping)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). While it's heating, grab a large mixing bowl and combine the shredded chicken, broccoli, cream of chicken soup, sour cream, and half the cheese. Season with garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Mix until everything is well combined.",
        "In a separate pot, cook your rice according to package instructions. This step usually takes about 15 minutes. Drain and set aside when done.",
        "Once the oven's ready, fold the cooked rice into the chicken mixture until everything is evenly coated. Spread the mixture into a greased casserole dish.",
        "Top it off with the remaining cheese and breadcrumbs if using. This adds a nice crunch that everyone loves.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown on top. You’ll know it's done when it starts smelling amazing.",
        "Let it cool for a few minutes before serving. I like to sprinkle some fresh herbs on top for a pop of color."
    ],
    "tips": "OK, so here are a few pro tips to make your casserole even better: \n1. Use leftover rotisserie chicken for a quicker prep. Seriously, it saves time!\n2. If you wanna add more flavor, try mixing in some cooked bacon or diced onions. They really amp up the taste.\n3. For a creamier texture, you can swap the sour cream for cream cheese. Just let it soften first.\n4. If you're not a broccoli fan, you can totally use green beans or cauliflower instead. Just make sure to cook them a little less to keep the crunch.\n5. Don't forget to keep an eye on the casserole while it's baking. You want that top to be golden, not burnt (trust me, I learned the hard way!).",
