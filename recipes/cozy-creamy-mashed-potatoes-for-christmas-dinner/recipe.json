    "ingredients": [
        "2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cubed",
        "1\/2 cup heavy cream, warmed",
        "1\/4 cup unsalted butter, melted",
        "3 cloves garlic, minced",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "Chives, chopped for garnish"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Begin by placing the peeled and cubed Yukon gold potatoes in a large pot. Cover them with cold water and add a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.",
        "Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and let the potatoes simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until they are fork-tender.",
        "While the potatoes cook, melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant, being careful not to brown it.",
        "Drain the cooked potatoes and return them to the pot. Begin mashing them with a potato masher or ricer until smooth.",
        "Pour in the warmed heavy cream and melted garlic butter, mixing until fully incorporated. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
        "Transfer the creamy mashed potatoes to a serving bowl and garnish with chopped chives before serving."
    ],
    "tips": "For perfectly creamy mashed potatoes, choose Yukon gold potatoes for their buttery flavor and smooth texture. Ensure the cream is warmed before adding it to prevent cooling the potatoes. If you prefer a lighter version, substitute half of the cream with chicken or vegetable broth. Avoid over-mixing to keep the potatoes fluffy. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days, and reheat gently on the stove with a splash of cream to revive their creamy texture.",
