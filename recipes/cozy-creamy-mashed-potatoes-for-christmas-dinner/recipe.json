    "servings": 4,
    "ingredients": [
        "2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and quartered",
        "1\/2 cup Kerrygold butter, unsalted",
        "1\/2 cup heavy cream (or Organic Valley cream)",
        "4 cloves garlic, minced (or use 3 if you're feeling mild)",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "Chives for garnish (optional)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Start by boiling a large pot of salted water. Toss in those peeled Yukon gold potatoes and cook for about 15 minutes, or until they're super tender. You'll know they're ready when a fork slides in easily.",
        "While the potatoes are cooking, melt the Kerrygold butter in a small pan over low heat. Add the minced garlic and let it cook for about 2 minutes until fragrant. Don't let it brown too much, trust me on this!",
        "Once the potatoes are done, drain them and return them to the pot. This is where the magic happens. Add the melted butter and garlic mixture, followed by the heavy cream. Now, mash everything together until it's creamy but still has a bit of texture.",
        "Season with salt and pepper to taste. Honestly, you might wanna taste it a couple of times to get it just right. If you're feeling fancy, sprinkle some chopped chives on top before serving.",
        "Serve these bad boys hot alongside your favorite main dish. They pair beautifully with roasted chicken or a big, juicy steak!"
    ],
    "tips": "OK, so here are some pro tips: First, if you want ultra-smooth potatoes, consider using a ricer instead of a masher. It makes a HUGE difference. Also, don't skip the garlic; it adds so much flavor—seriously, it's a game changer. If you're making this ahead of time, keep them in a warm oven (around 200°F) until you're ready to serve. Just be careful not to let them dry out. And remember, the cream can be swapped for half-and-half if you're looking to save on calories, but it won't be quite as rich. Lastly, for a fun twist, try adding some roasted garlic instead of fresh for a deeper flavor.",

It was such a cozy vibe, and honestly, the aroma of garlic wafting through the air was unbelievable. Lisa said, \"You HAVE to try these potatoes!\" I couldn’t believe how buttery and smooth they were. Now, I make them every holiday season, and my kids, who are typically picky eaters, devour them like they’re the last thing on earth. They always say, \"Mom, can we have these again?\"<\/p>"
