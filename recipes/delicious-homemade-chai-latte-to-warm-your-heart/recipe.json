    "ingredients": [
        "2 cups water",
        "2 bags of black tea (or 2 tablespoons loose leaf)",
        "1 cinnamon stick",
        "4-5 whole cloves",
        "4-5 cardamom pods, crushed",
        "1 teaspoon fresh ginger, grated",
        "1 cup milk (I use whole milk, but almond or oat works too)",
        "2 tablespoons honey or sugar (adjust to taste)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "In a small saucepan, bring the water to a boil. Toss in the tea bags, cinnamon stick, cloves, cardamom, and grated ginger. Let it simmer for about 10 minutes. Seriously, it should smell amazing by now.",
        "While that's going, heat up the milk in another pot, but don't let it boil. Just warm it until it's steaming, you know?",
        "Once the tea has brewed, strain it into a mug, removing all those spices. I usually just use a small sieve - works like a charm.",
        "Now, add the warm milk to your spiced tea. Stir in your honey or sugar until it dissolves. Taste it! Want it sweeter? Add more.",
        "Top it off with a sprinkle of cinnamon or nutmeg for that extra cozy vibe. Seriously, looks fancy!"
    ],
    "tips": "OK, so here are some things I’ve learned along the way. First, use fresh spices if you can; they make a world of difference. I always double the ginger because, honestly, I love that kick. Also, don’t skip the straining step – trust me, the texture is way better without floating spices. If you want to make it ahead, just store the brewed tea in the fridge and heat it up later. And yeah, I once forgot the sugar and let me tell you, it wasn’t great. Now I always taste and adjust before serving.",

My daughter even said, \"Mom, this is better than the coffee shop!\" That moment? Pure joy.<\/p>"

Look for loose leaf if you can; it’s usually fresher.<\/li><li><strong>Spices:<\/strong> Fresh spices really amp up the flavor. I like using Kerrygold butter for a richer taste in any creamy additions.<\/li><li><strong>Milk:<\/strong> Whole milk gives that creamy texture, but you can use almond or oat milk if dairy's not your jam. Just remember that it might change the flavor a bit.<\/li><li><strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> Honey is a great natural sweetener, but maple syrup works too for a different twist. If you're out of honey, brown sugar does the trick!<\/li><\/ul><\/p>"
