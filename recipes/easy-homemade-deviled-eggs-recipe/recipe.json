    "ingredients": [
        "6 large eggs, hard-boiled and peeled",
        "1\/4 cup mayonnaise",
        "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard",
        "1 teaspoon white vinegar",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "Paprika for garnish",
        "Fresh chives, finely chopped (optional)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Start by placing the hard-boiled eggs in a pot and cover them with cold water. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then cover and remove from heat. Let them sit for 10 minutes before transferring to an ice bath to cool.",
        "Once cooled, gently tap the eggs on a hard surface to crack the shell, then peel them under running water for easier removal.",
        "Slice each egg in half lengthwise and carefully scoop out the yolks into a mixing bowl. Place the egg whites on a serving platter.",
        "Mash the yolks with a fork and mix in the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, white vinegar, salt, and pepper until smooth and creamy.",
        "Spoon or pipe the yolk mixture back into the egg whites, filling each half generously.",
        "Sprinkle with paprika and chopped chives for a pop of color before serving."
    ],
    "tips": "To achieve perfectly hard-boiled eggs, ensure you start with eggs that are at least a week old for easier peeling. For a creamier filling, consider adding a splash of pickle juice or a dash of hot sauce for an extra kick. If you're preparing these ahead of time, store the filled eggs in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to two days. When reheating, avoid microwaving as it can make the eggs rubbery; instead, let them come to room temperature before serving. For a fun twist, try adding ingredients like avocado or bacon bits to the yolk mixture for added flavor.",
