Look for berries that are firm and vibrant in color. \n- If you want to add a little zing, consider drizzling a bit of berry syrup or fruit compote between the layers. \n- Avoid over-soaking the cake with pudding; it should be moist but not soggy. \n- For a beautiful presentation, use a clear trifle dish to showcase the layers. \n- Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, but the texture may change slightly as the cake absorbs moisture.",
