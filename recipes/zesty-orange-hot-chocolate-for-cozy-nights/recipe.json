    "tips": "To enhance your zesty orange hot chocolate, consider these professional tips: \n- Use fresh orange zest for a vibrant flavor. When selecting oranges, look for firm, fragrant ones. Avoid over-grating the zest to prevent bitterness. \n- For a richer taste, opt for whole milk or a creamy alternative like oat milk. If you're dairy-free, coconut milk adds a delightful tropical twist. \n- A common mistake is boiling the milk, which can lead to a burnt taste. Heat gently and stir continuously to maintain a smooth texture. \n- Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Reheat gently on the stove or in the microwave, adding a splash of milk if it thickens too much. \n- For a unique flavor profile, try adding a dash of cinnamon or a hint of chili powder for warmth.",
