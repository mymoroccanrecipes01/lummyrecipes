    "ingredients": [
        "4 large eggs, separated",
        "1 cup granulated sugar",
        "1\/2 cup all-purpose flour, sifted",
        "1\/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder",
        "1\/4 teaspoon salt",
        "1\/2 teaspoon baking powder",

    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a 15x10-inch jelly roll pan with parchment paper, ensuring it extends over the edges.",
        "In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks and granulated sugar until the mixture is pale and thick. Gradually fold in the sifted flour, cocoa powder, salt, and baking powder until just combined.",
        "In a separate bowl, whip the egg whites until stiff peaks form, then gently fold them into the chocolate mixture to maintain the airy texture.",
        "Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the cake springs back when lightly touched.",
        "Once baked, remove from the oven and let it cool in the pan for 5 minutes before inverting onto a clean kitchen towel dusted with powdered sugar. Carefully peel off the parchment paper.",
        "While the cake cools, whip the heavy cream with powdered sugar and vanilla until soft peaks form. Spread the whipped cream over the cooled cake, then roll it up tightly from one short end, using the towel to assist. Chill for 30 minutes before serving."
    ],
    "tips": "To ensure a perfect Yule log, make sure to whip the egg whites until they are very stiff; this will give your cake a light and airy texture. When rolling the cake, do it while it's still warm to prevent cracking. If you want to add a twist, consider incorporating a splash of coffee or orange zest into the whipped cream for added flavor. For storage, wrap the log tightly in plastic wrap and keep it in the refrigerator for up to three days. When ready to serve, dust with cocoa powder or powdered sugar for a festive touch.",

Choose high-quality cocoa for the best results, as it significantly impacts the overall taste of the cake.<\/li><li><strong>Supporting ingredients:<\/strong> Heavy cream adds richness and a luxurious texture to the filling. Use cold cream for easier whipping, and consider chilling your mixing bowl for even better results.<\/li><li><strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> For a lighter version, you can substitute half of the heavy cream with Greek yogurt. Alternatively, for a gluten-free option, use a gluten-free flour blend in place of all-purpose flour.<\/li><li><strong>Equipment needed:<\/strong> A jelly roll pan is essential for baking the cake evenly. A hand mixer or stand mixer will make whipping the egg whites and cream much easier.<\/li><\/ul><\/p>"
