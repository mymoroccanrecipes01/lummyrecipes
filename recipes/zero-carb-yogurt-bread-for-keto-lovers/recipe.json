    "servings": 8,
    "ingredients": [
        "1 cup plain Greek yogurt, full-fat",
        "2 large eggs, room temperature",
        "1 1\/2 cups almond flour, finely ground",
        "1\/2 cup coconut flour, sifted",
        "1 tablespoon baking powder",
        "1\/2 teaspoon salt",
        "1 tablespoon olive oil or melted butter",
        "1 teaspoon garlic powder (optional for flavor)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a loaf pan with cooking spray or line it with parchment paper for easy removal.",
        "In a large mixing bowl, combine the Greek yogurt and eggs, whisking until smooth and well blended.",
        "In another bowl, mix the almond flour, coconut flour, baking powder, salt, and garlic powder if using. Gradually add this dry mixture to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined.",
        "Fold in the olive oil or melted butter, ensuring the mixture is well incorporated but not overmixed.",
        "Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan, smoothing the top with a spatula. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted comes out clean.",
        "Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve as desired."
    ],
    "tips": "To achieve the best texture, ensure your yogurt is thick and creamy. If you find the dough too wet, add a bit more almond flour until it reaches a manageable consistency. Avoid overmixing the batter to keep the bread light and fluffy. For storage, wrap the cooled bread tightly in plastic wrap and keep it in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze slices for up to three months; just toast them directly from frozen for a quick snack. When reheating, a few seconds in the microwave or a quick toast will bring back its delightful texture.",
