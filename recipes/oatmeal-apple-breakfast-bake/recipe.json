        "2 tablespoons melted coconut oil or butter"

    "tips": "To ensure your oatmeal bake is perfectly moist, avoid overbaking; check for a slight jiggle in the center when you remove it from the oven. Use fresh, crisp apples for the best flavor, and feel free to mix in other fruits like berries or bananas for variety. If you prefer a sweeter dish, increase the sugar or syrup slightly. For storage, keep leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat individual portions in the microwave for a quick breakfast. Experiment with spices like ginger or cardamom for a unique twist!",
