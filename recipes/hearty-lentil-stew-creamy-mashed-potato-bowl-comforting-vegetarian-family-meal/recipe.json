    "ingredients": [
        "1 cup dried lentils, rinsed and drained",
        "4 cups vegetable broth",
        "1 medium onion, diced",
        "2 carrots, chopped",
        "2 celery stalks, chopped",
        "3 cloves garlic, minced",
        "1 teaspoon ground cumin",

        "2 tablespoons olive oil",
        "2 cups mashed potatoes, prepared with butter and milk"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion, carrots, and celery, sautéing until softened, about 5-7 minutes.",

    "tips": "To enhance the flavor of your lentil stew, consider adding a splash of balsamic vinegar or a squeeze of lemon juice just before serving. This adds brightness to the dish. When selecting lentils, choose green or brown varieties for a hearty texture. Avoid overcooking the lentils, as they can become mushy; they should hold their shape. For storage, keep leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stove, adding a splash of broth if it thickens too much. Lastly, feel free to customize the stew by adding your favorite vegetables, such as spinach or bell peppers, for added nutrition and flavor.",
