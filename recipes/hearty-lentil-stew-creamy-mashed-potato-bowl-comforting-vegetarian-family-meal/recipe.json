        "1 cup dried lentils, rinsed and drained",
        "4 cups vegetable broth",
        "1 medium onion, chopped",
        "2 cloves garlic, minced",
        "2 carrots, diced",
        "2 celery stalks, diced",
        "1 teaspoon ground cumin",
        "1 teaspoon smoked paprika",

    "instructions": [
        "In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes.",
        "Stir in the garlic, carrots, and celery, cooking for another 5 minutes until the vegetables soften.",

    "tips": "To enhance the flavor of your lentil stew, consider adding a splash of lemon juice just before serving for brightness. When selecting lentils, opt for green or brown varieties as they hold their shape well during cooking. Avoid overcooking the lentils to maintain a pleasant texture; they should be tender but not mushy. For storage, keep the stew in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Reheat gently on the stove, adding a bit of broth if it thickens too much. If you want to make a larger batch, this stew freezes well; just ensure it's cooled completely before transferring to freezer-safe containers.",
