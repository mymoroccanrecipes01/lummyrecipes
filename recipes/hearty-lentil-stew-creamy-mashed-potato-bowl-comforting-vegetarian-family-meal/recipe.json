    "tips": "Listen, making lentil stew is all about balance and flavor. Here are some tips to nail it:\n\n1. **Texture is key**: If you want a thicker stew, let it simmer uncovered for the last 5 minutes, allowing some liquid to evaporate. My ancient cast iron skillet holds heat well, so it works great.\n\n2. **Spice it up**: Don't be shy with your spices! I like to double the cumin for an extra kick, but you can start with the original amount and adjust to your taste.\n\n3. **Storage magic**: This stew keeps well in the fridge for about 3-4 days. Just reheat gently on the stove. If it thickens too much, add a splash of broth!\n\n4. **Make ahead**: You can prep the veggies a day in advance. Just chop them up and store in the fridge. Less work when it’s time to cook!\n\n5. **Different oils**: If you're low on olive oil, feel free to use canola or avocado oil. Both work well and won't change the flavor much.",
