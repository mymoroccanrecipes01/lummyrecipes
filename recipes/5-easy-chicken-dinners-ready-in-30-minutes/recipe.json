    "ingredients": [
        "4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, trimmed",
        "2 tablespoons olive oil",
        "1 teaspoon garlic powder",
        "1 teaspoon paprika",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved",
        "1 cup spinach leaves, fresh",
        "1/2 cup feta cheese, crumbled",
        "1 lemon, juiced"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Begin by seasoning the chicken breasts with garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper on both sides.",
        "In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the chicken and cook for about 6-7 minutes on each side until golden brown and cooked through.",
        "Add the halved cherry tomatoes and spinach to the skillet, stirring gently to combine. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the spinach wilts.",
        "Drizzle the lemon juice over the chicken and vegetables, then sprinkle the crumbled feta cheese on top.",
        "Remove from heat and let it rest for a few minutes before serving to allow the flavors to meld.",
        "Serve warm, garnished with additional lemon wedges if desired."
    ],
    "tips": "To ensure your chicken is juicy, avoid overcooking it. Use a meat thermometer to check for an internal temperature of 165°F. For a flavor boost, marinate the chicken in olive oil, lemon juice, and herbs for 30 minutes before cooking. If you're short on time, consider using pre-cooked chicken or rotisserie chicken for a quicker meal. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently in the microwave or on the stovetop to maintain moisture.",
