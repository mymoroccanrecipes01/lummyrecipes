        "1 tablespoon olive oil",
        "1 medium onion, chopped",
        "2 cloves garlic, minced",
        "2 carrots, diced",
        "2 stalks celery, diced",

    "instructions": [
        "First, heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Toss in the chopped onion and sauté for about 3 minutes until it softens.",
        "Next, add the minced garlic, carrots, and celery. Cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally until everything is fragrant and slightly tender.",
        "Then, stir in the bell pepper, zucchini, and canned tomatoes. Pour in the vegetable broth and bring the mixture to a boil.",
        "Once boiling, reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes, until the veggies are soft but still vibrant.",
        "Add the oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper. Give it a good stir and let it simmer for another couple of minutes.",
        "Finally, ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with fresh parsley before serving."

    "tips": "When making this soup, I always use my KitchenAid pot because it distributes heat evenly. If you want a thicker consistency, try blending a cup of the soup and mixing it back in. And trust me, letting the soup sit for a few minutes off the heat really helps the flavors meld together. Don’t skip on salt; it’s crucial for balancing the flavors. If you're in a hurry, pre-chop your veggies the night before! This soup also freezes well—just let it cool completely and store it in airtight containers for up to 3 months.",

They add color and texture, and trust me, they are the stars of the show. When shopping, look for firm and vibrant veggies to pack in the flavor.</p><p><strong>Key seasonings/aromatics:</strong> Garlic and onions are essential for building that rich base flavor. I usually use organic garlic from Whole Foods since it’s super fragrant.</p><p><strong>Supporting ingredients:</strong> The canned tomatoes add a nice acidity, balancing out the sweetness of the veggies. I prefer using organic diced tomatoes to keep it wholesome.</p><p><strong>Smart substitutions:</strong> If you don’t have vegetable broth, water works, but you might want to add more spices. Also, feel free to swap out any veggies with what you have on hand—like green beans or peas!</p><p><strong>Equipment needed:</strong> A sturdy pot is key. My KitchenAid pot is perfect because it distributes heat evenly, ensuring everything cooks without burning.</p>"

Just store them in airtight containers. When cooking, keep the heat medium so you don’t scorch anything—about a 5-6 on most stoves is good. Simmer for around 10-15 minutes; you know it’s ready when the veggies are tender but not mushy. For finishing touches, serve it hot with some crusty bread on the side—it’s amazing!</p>"

Want to jazz it up? Try adding a splash of soy sauce or sriracha for an Asian twist. You can even switch out the broth for coconut milk if you’re in the mood for something creamy and tropical. Each variation brings its own unique flavor profile, so don't be afraid to get creative!</p>"
