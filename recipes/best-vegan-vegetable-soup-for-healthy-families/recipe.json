        "2 tablespoons olive oil",
        "1 medium onion, chopped",
        "2 cloves garlic, minced",
        "3 cups vegetable broth",
        "2 medium carrots, diced",
        "2 celery stalks, diced",
        "1 zucchini, diced",
        "1 red bell pepper, diced",

    "instructions": [
        "In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, sautéing until fragrant and translucent, about 3-4 minutes.",
        "Pour in the vegetable broth and bring it to a simmer. Add the diced carrots and celery, cooking until tender, roughly 5-7 minutes.",
        "Stir in the zucchini, red bell pepper, diced tomatoes, thyme, and basil. Season with salt and pepper as desired.",
        "Let the soup simmer for another 10-15 minutes, allowing those flavors to meld together. You want it bubbling lightly.",
        "Taste and adjust seasoning if needed. Serve hot, garnished with fresh parsley."
    ],
    "tips": "Here are some tips to make your soup even better: \n1. Use fresh, seasonal vegetables for the best flavor — farmer's markets are great for finding these gems! \n2. If you like a little kick, add crushed red pepper flakes when sautéing the onions. \n3. Want a heartier soup? Throw in some cooked quinoa or lentils for protein. \n4. Leftovers? Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days. Just reheat gently on the stove. \n5. Pro tip: If you have a KitchenAid immersion blender, blend a portion for a creamy texture while keeping some chunks for that rustic feel.",
