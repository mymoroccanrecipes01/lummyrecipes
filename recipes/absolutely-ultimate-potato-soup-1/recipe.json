        "2 stalks celery, diced",
        "1 onion, chopped",
        "3 cloves garlic, minced",
        "8 potatoes, peeled and cubed",
        "4 cups chicken stock, or enough to cover potatoes",
        "3 tablespoons butter",

        "Place bacon in a Dutch oven and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, 5 to 10 minutes.",
        "Drain bacon pieces on paper towels and reserve 1\/4 cup of the bacon grease in the pot; discard the rest.",

        "Stir in garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes until fragrant.",
        "Add cubed potatoes and toss to coat, sautéing for 3 to 4 minutes.",
        "Return bacon to the pot and add enough chicken stock to just cover the potatoes.",

    "tips": "For a bacon-free version, substitute 1\/4 cup melted butter for the bacon grease to maintain richness. When blending, be careful with hot liquids—blend in batches and vent the lid slightly to avoid splatters. Use Yukon Gold potatoes for a creamier texture. Fresh herbs brighten the soup, so add them just before serving if possible.",
