    "ingredients": [
        "1 loaf of crusty bread, cubed and dried",
        "1 cup celery, finely chopped",
        "1 cup onion, diced",
        "1\/2 cup carrots, grated",
        "1\/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped",
        "2 teaspoons dried sage",
        "1 teaspoon dried thyme",
        "1\/2 teaspoon salt",
        "1\/4 teaspoon black pepper",
        "2 cups vegetable or chicken broth",
        "2 large eggs, beaten"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Begin by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Spread the cubed bread on a baking sheet and toast for about 10 minutes until lightly golden.",
        "In a large skillet over medium heat, sauté the chopped celery, onion, and grated carrots until softened, approximately 5-7 minutes.",
        "In a large mixing bowl, combine the toasted bread cubes, sautéed vegetables, parsley, sage, thyme, salt, and pepper. Toss well to mix all ingredients evenly.",
        "Pour in the broth gradually, mixing until the bread is moistened but not soggy. Add the beaten eggs and stir until fully incorporated.",
        "Transfer the stuffing mixture to a greased baking dish, cover with foil, and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes until the top is crispy and golden."
    ],
    "tips": "When preparing stuffing, ensure your bread is adequately dried to absorb the broth without becoming mushy. If you prefer a more robust flavor, consider adding sautéed mushrooms or diced apples for a hint of sweetness. Always taste and adjust seasoning as needed before baking. For storage, keep any leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven at 350°F (175°C) until warmed through, about 20 minutes. If you want to make it ahead of time, prepare the stuffing up to the baking step, cover tightly, and refrigerate for up to 24 hours before baking.",
