    "ingredients": [
        "2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted",
        "1 ¾ cups granulated sugar",
        "¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder",
        "1 ½ teaspoons baking powder",
        "1 ½ teaspoons baking soda",
        "1 teaspoon salt",
        "2 large eggs",
        "1 cup whole milk",
        "½ cup vegetable oil",
        "2 teaspoons vanilla extract",
        "1 cup boiling water",
        "1 cup chocolate ganache for filling",
        "Buttercream frosting for decoration",
        "Colorful fondant for details"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease two round cake pans. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk until well blended.",
        "Add the eggs, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Mix on medium speed for about 2 minutes until smooth. Carefully stir in the boiling water until the batter is well combined; it will be thin.",
        "Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pans and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.",
        "Once cooled, slice the top off each cake layer to create a flat surface. Place one layer on a serving plate and spread a generous amount of chocolate ganache on top. Place the second layer on top and press gently.",
        "Cover the entire cake with a layer of buttercream frosting, smoothing it out with a spatula. Use colorful fondant to create playful decorations, shaping them into fun rat features.",
        "Serve the cake at room temperature and enjoy the delightful surprise inside!"
    ],
    "tips": "1. For a richer flavor, use high-quality cocoa powder. It makes a significant difference in the cake's taste. 2. Make sure to measure your ingredients accurately for the best results. Baking is a science! 3. If you're short on time, you can use store-bought frosting and fondant. 4. To store leftovers, keep the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, refrigerate for up to a week. 5. When decorating with fondant, ensure your buttercream is slightly chilled to help the fondant adhere better.",
