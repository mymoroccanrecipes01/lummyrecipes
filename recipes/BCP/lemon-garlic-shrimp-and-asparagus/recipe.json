        "1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined",
        "1 bunch asparagus, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces",
        "4 cloves garlic, minced",
        "1 lemon, juiced and zested",

        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "Fresh parsley, chopped for garnish"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Begin by heating olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add minced garlic and sauté for about 30 seconds until fragrant.",
        "Add the asparagus pieces to the skillet and cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they turn bright green and tender-crisp.",
        "Stir in the shrimp, lemon juice, and zest. Season with salt and pepper. Cook for an additional 3-4 minutes, or until the shrimp are pink and opaque.",

    "tips": "To achieve the best results with this dish, consider these professional tips: \n- When selecting shrimp, look for those that are firm and have a slight sheen. Fresh shrimp should smell like the ocean, not fishy. \n- Avoid overcooking the shrimp; they cook quickly and should only be cooked until they turn pink and opaque. \n- For added depth of flavor, consider marinating the shrimp in lemon juice and garlic for 15-30 minutes before cooking. \n- If you have leftovers, store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop to avoid rubbery shrimp. \n- Pair this dish with a light white wine, such as Sauvignon Blanc, to complement the citrus flavors.",

            "content": "<p><strong>Main ingredient (protein/base):</strong> Shrimp are the star of this dish, providing a sweet and tender bite. Look for fresh or frozen shrimp that are firm and have a slight sheen. If using frozen, ensure they are fully thawed before cooking for even results.</li><li><strong>Key seasonings/aromatics:</strong> Garlic is essential for building flavor; it adds a savory depth that complements the shrimp beautifully. Fresh garlic is recommended for the best taste, but garlic powder can be used in a pinch.</li><li><strong>Supporting ingredients:</strong> Asparagus adds a vibrant crunch and a pop of color. Choose firm stalks that are bright green. You can also substitute with green beans or broccoli for a different texture.</li><li><strong>Smart substitutions:</strong> For a lighter option, use zucchini noodles instead of asparagus. Alternatively, swap shrimp for scallops for a luxurious twist. Both options will change the flavor profile while maintaining the dish's essence.</li><li><strong>Equipment needed:</strong> A large skillet is essential for even cooking and to allow the shrimp to sear properly. A good quality spatula will help in tossing the ingredients without breaking them.</li></ul>"
