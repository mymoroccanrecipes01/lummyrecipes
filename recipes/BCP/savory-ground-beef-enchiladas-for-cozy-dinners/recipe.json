    "ingredients": [
        "1 pound ground beef, seasoned",
        "1 can (10 oz) enchilada sauce, plus extra for topping",
        "8 small flour tortillas",
        "1 cup shredded cheese (I use Tillamook cheddar)",
        "1\/2 cup chopped onion",
        "1 teaspoon garlic powder",
        "1 teaspoon cumin",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "Optional toppings: sour cream, chopped cilantro"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "OK, first things first: preheat your oven to 350°F. While that’s heating up, brown the ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat. Toss in the chopped onion and season with garlic powder, cumin, salt, and pepper. Cook until the beef is fully browned and the onions are soft.",
        "Next, stir in about half of the enchilada sauce into the beef mix. This is where the flavor magic happens. Grab your tortillas and spoon some of that beef mixture onto each one, sprinkle a little cheese on top, and roll them up tightly.",
        "Now, place the rolled enchiladas seam-side down in a greased baking dish. Pour the remaining enchilada sauce over the top and sprinkle with the rest of the cheese. Seriously, don’t skimp on the cheese here. It’s like the crown jewel!",
        "Pop that baking dish in the oven for about 20 minutes. You’ll know they’re ready when the cheese is melted and bubbling. I mean, how good does that sound?",
        "Let them cool for a few minutes before serving. And trust me, a dollop of sour cream and some fresh cilantro on top really takes it up a notch!"
    ],
    "tips": "1. Use a good quality ground beef. I usually go with 80\/20 for that perfect balance of flavor and juiciness. 2. If your kids are like mine and tend to be picky, go easy on the spices at first. You can always add more later! 3. Leftover enchiladas? They taste even better the next day, trust me. Just heat them up in the oven at 350°F for about 15 minutes. 4. For a fun twist, try adding black beans or corn to the beef mixture for some extra texture and nutrition. 5. If you're feeling adventurous, experiment with different cheeses like pepper jack for a spicy kick.",

Look for fresh ground beef from a reputable source, especially if you’re feeding kids.<br><strong>Key seasonings\/aromatics:<\/strong> Cumin and garlic powder are my go-to flavor boosters. They really add depth to the beef. I grab Bob's Red Mill spices for quality and flavor.<br><strong>Supporting ingredients:<\/strong> Tortillas are the backbone of this dish. I prefer flour for their softness, but corn works too if you’re feeling traditional. Make sure they are fresh and pliable.<br><strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> If you want to go lighter, ground turkey works surprisingly well! For a vegan option, use lentils or black beans instead of meat.<br><strong>Equipment needed:<\/strong> A good skillet for browning meat is key - I love using my trusty KitchenAid nonstick skillet. It makes cleanup a breeze!<\/p>"

You want it to be nice and crumbly. Stir in half the enchilada sauce to infuse that flavor. Then, fill your tortillas and roll them up tight.<br><strong>Finishing touches:<\/strong> After baking, let them rest before serving.
