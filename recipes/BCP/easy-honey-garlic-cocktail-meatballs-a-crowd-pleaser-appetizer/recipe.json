    "ingredients": [
        "1 pound ground beef or turkey",
        "1\/2 cup breadcrumbs (I use Bob's Red Mill)",
        "1\/4 cup minced onion",
        "1 egg",
        "2 cloves garlic, minced (OK, maybe 3 for good measure)",
        "1\/4 cup honey",
        "1\/4 cup soy sauce",
        "1 tablespoon sesame oil",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "Chopped green onions for garnish"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 400°F (that's 200°C for my friends outside the US).",
        "In a large bowl, mix the ground meat, breadcrumbs, onion, egg, garlic, salt, and pepper until combined. Don't overmix!",
        "Shape the mixture into small meatballs, about 1 inch in diameter. This should give you around 20-25 meatballs.",
        "Place the meatballs on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake for 20 minutes, or until they're golden brown and cooked through.",
        "While the meatballs bake, whisk together honey, soy sauce, and sesame oil in a small saucepan over medium heat until it bubbles slightly.",
        "Once the meatballs are done, toss them in the honey garlic sauce and serve warm with toothpicks. Garnish with chopped green onions!"
    ],
    "tips": "Listen, I’ve got some pro tips to make these meatballs even better! First off, if you want a little heat, add some red pepper flakes to the sauce. If you're short on time, you can use pre-made meatballs from the store (don't judge me). And honestly, these freeze really well! Just make sure to bake them first, then toss them in sauce when you reheat. Also, you can double the sauce if you like it saucy! I always do.",

I use fresh garlic for that aromatic kick, but garlic powder can work in a pinch.<\/li><li><strong>Supporting ingredients:<\/strong> Breadcrumbs keep the meatballs tender. I always use Bob's Red Mill because they're reliable and add great texture.<\/li><li><strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> If you're out of honey, maple syrup can work too (not as sweet, but still tasty). Also, tamari is a great gluten-free alternative to soy sauce.<\/li><li><strong>Equipment needed:<\/strong> A good mixing bowl is essential (I love my KitchenAid mixing bowl for this), and a baking sheet lined with parchment paper makes cleanup a breeze.<\/li><\/ul><\/p>"
