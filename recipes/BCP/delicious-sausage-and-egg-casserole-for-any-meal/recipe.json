    "tips": "One key tip is to let the casserole sit for a few minutes after baking; it helps it set better. A common mistake is overcooking the eggs, so keep an eye on it! If you want to add veggies, bell peppers or spinach work great. You can also use any cheese you prefer—Monterey Jack adds a nice twist!",
