    "servings": 4,
    "ingredients": [
        "1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces",
        "2 tablespoons olive oil",
        "1 medium onion, finely chopped",
        "3 cloves garlic, minced",
        "2-3 fresh jalapeños, diced (adjust for spice level)",
        "1 cup heavy cream",
        "1 cup shredded cheddar cheese",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "Fresh cilantro for garnish"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent, about 3-4 minutes.",
        "Stir in the minced garlic and diced jalapeños, cooking for an additional 2 minutes until fragrant.",
        "Add the chicken pieces to the skillet, seasoning with salt and pepper. Cook until the chicken is browned and cooked through, around 6-8 minutes.",
        "Pour in the heavy cream, stirring to combine. Allow the mixture to simmer for 5 minutes until slightly thickened.",
        "Remove from heat and mix in the shredded cheddar cheese until melted and creamy. Garnish with fresh cilantro before serving."
    ],
    "tips": "To elevate your creamy jalapeño chicken skillet, consider these professional tips: \n- For a richer flavor, use smoked paprika alongside the jalapeños. It adds depth and a subtle smokiness that complements the dish beautifully. \n- Ensure your chicken is cut into uniform pieces for even cooking. This prevents some pieces from being overcooked while others remain undercooked. \n- If you prefer a thicker sauce, let the cream simmer longer, stirring occasionally. This will help it reduce and concentrate the flavors. \n- Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stove over low heat to maintain creaminess. \n- For a spicy kick, consider adding a pinch of cayenne pepper or a splash of hot sauce to the cream mixture.",
