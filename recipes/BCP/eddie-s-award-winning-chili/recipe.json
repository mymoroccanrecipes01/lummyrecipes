    "ingredients": [
        "1 pound ground beef, lean",
        "1 medium onion, chopped",
        "2 cloves garlic, minced",
        "1 can (15 ounces) kidney beans, drained and rinsed",
        "1 can (15 ounces) black beans, drained and rinsed",
        "1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes",
        "2 tablespoons chili powder",
        "1 teaspoon cumin",
        "1 teaspoon smoked paprika",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "1 cup beef broth",
        "Fresh cilantro for garnish"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "In a large pot over medium heat, brown the ground beef until fully cooked, about 5-7 minutes. Drain excess fat if necessary.",
        "Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the pot, sautéing until the onion is translucent, about 3-4 minutes.",
        "Stir in the chili powder, cumin, and smoked paprika, cooking for another minute to release the spices' aromas.",
        "Pour in the crushed tomatoes, kidney beans, black beans, and beef broth. Stir well to combine all ingredients.",

    "tips": "To elevate your chili, consider these professional tips: \n- Choose high-quality ground beef for better flavor and texture. Look for 80\/20 lean-to-fat ratio for a juicy result. \n- Don’t skip the sautéing step for the onions and garlic; it builds a flavorful base. \n- If you prefer a spicier kick, add diced jalapeños or a dash of cayenne pepper during cooking. \n- For storage, let the chili cool completely before transferring it to an airtight container. It can be refrigerated for up to 4 days or frozen for up to 3 months. Reheat gently on the stove or in the microwave, adding a splash of broth if it thickens too much. \n- Serve with crusty bread or over rice for a heartier meal, and don’t forget to taste and adjust seasoning before serving.",

If you prefer a leaner option, ground turkey or chicken can be substituted, though they may yield a lighter flavor.<\/li><li><strong>Key seasonings\/aromatics:<\/strong> Chili powder and cumin are essential for building depth in flavor. Opt for fresh spices for the best aroma and taste. Smoked paprika adds a wonderful smokiness that elevates the dish.<\/li><li><strong>Supporting ingredients:<\/strong> Beans add heartiness and fiber, while crushed tomatoes provide a rich base. Rinsing the beans helps reduce sodium and improves texture.<\/li><li><strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> For a vegetarian version, replace the meat with lentils or a mix of beans. You can also use vegetable broth instead of beef broth for a lighter taste.<\/li><li><strong>Equipment needed:<\/strong> A large pot or Dutch oven is essential for even cooking and flavor development. A wooden spoon is great for stirring, while a sharp knife and cutting board are necessary for chopping ingredients.<\/li><\/ul><\/p>"
