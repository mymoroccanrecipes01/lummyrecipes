    "ingredients": [
        "1 pound chicken breast, sliced thin",
        "1\/2 cup teriyaki sauce (I use Kikkoman)",
        "4 large flour tortillas or wraps",
        "1 cup shredded lettuce (I prefer romaine for crunch)",
        "1\/2 cup shredded carrots",
        "1\/2 bell pepper, sliced (any color you like)",

        "OK, first things first, marinate that chicken! Toss the sliced chicken in a bowl with teriyaki sauce and let it sit for about 10 minutes. This is key for flavor!",
        "Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the marinated chicken and cook for about 5-7 minutes or until it's cooked through and starting to get a nice glaze. You know it’s done when it’s no longer pink inside.",
        "While that’s happening, prep your veggies! Chop the lettuce, slice the bell pepper, and get those carrots ready. You wanna load these wraps up with fresh goodness.",
        "Now, it’s wrapping time! Lay out a tortilla, layer on some lettuce, chicken, bell pepper, and carrots. Don’t skimp here – go for it!",
        "Roll the wrap tightly, tucking in the sides as you go. Cut in half if you want to show off that colorful filling. Sprinkle some sesame seeds and green onions on top for that extra flair."
    ],
    "tips": "So listen, here are some tips that’ll make your wraps even better:\n\n1. Temperature matters – cook that chicken over medium heat. Too high and it’ll dry out.\n2. Prep your veggies ahead of time. You can even do this the night before! It saves time when you’re in a rush.\n3. Got leftovers? These wraps keep well in the fridge, but I’d eat them within two days. Just wrap them tightly.\n4. If you want a little kick, add some sriracha or your favorite hot sauce to the wraps. It’ll change the game!\n5. For a fun twist, try using different proteins like shrimp or tofu. Seriously, it’s all good.\n\nNow, let's get cooking!",
