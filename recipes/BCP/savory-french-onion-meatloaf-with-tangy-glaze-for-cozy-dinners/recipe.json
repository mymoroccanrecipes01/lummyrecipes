    "ingredients": [
        "2 pounds ground beef, preferably grass-fed",
        "1 large onion, finely chopped",
        "1 cup breadcrumbs, I use Bob's Red Mill",
        "2 large eggs, beaten",
        "1\/2 cup shredded cheese, like Kerrygold cheddar",
        "1\/4 cup milk",
        "1\/4 cup ketchup",
        "2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "1 tablespoon fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried thyme",
        "Olive oil for sautéing"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "First off, preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Seriously, don’t skip this step.",
        "In a skillet, heat a splash of olive oil over medium heat and add the chopped onion. Cook until they're soft and golden, about 10 minutes. Just keep stirring so they don’t burn.",
        "In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, breadcrumbs, eggs, milk, Worcestershire sauce, thyme, and cooked onions. Mix it up with your hands – it's messy, but trust me, it's the best way.",
        "Shape the mixture into a loaf and place it in a baking dish. Spread ketchup over the top like a glaze – it adds a nice tang!",
        "Bake for 45 minutes. You’ll know it’s done when the internal temperature hits 160°F (70°C). Let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing... and then dig in!"
    ],
    "tips": "So, here are a few things I learned while making this meatloaf: \n1. Use fresh herbs if you can – they really amp up the flavor. I mean, dried thyme works, but fresh is just... better. \n2. Don’t forget to let the meatloaf rest after baking! It helps everything settle, and you won’t have a mess when slicing. \n3. If you want a little kick, try adding a teaspoon of hot sauce to the mixture. My neighbor Susan swears by it. \n4. Leftovers? They taste even better the next day. Just pop them in the microwave or a skillet to reheat. \n5. And if you’re feeding picky kids, serve with mashed potatoes – they’ll love it!",

It really enhances the flavor and makes the meatloaf juicy. I always lean towards 80\/20 for the right fat content.<\/li><li><strong>Key seasonings\/aromatics:<\/strong> Onions are essential – they add sweetness and depth. I usually opt for yellow onions for their flavor. Sauté them well; it’s worth the time.<\/li><li><strong>Supporting ingredients:<\/strong> Breadcrumbs hold everything together and give that perfect texture. I use Bob's Red Mill because they’re fresh and fluffy.<\/li><li><strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> You can swap ground turkey for beef if you want something lighter. Just know it might be a little dryer, so maybe add an extra egg or some moisture.<\/li><li><strong>Equipment needed:<\/strong> A good mixing bowl is crucial for this. I love my KitchenAid mixing bowl for its size and stability while mixing everything together.<\/li><\/ul><\/p>"
