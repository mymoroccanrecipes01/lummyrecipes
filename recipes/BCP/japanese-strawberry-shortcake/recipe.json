        "In another bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt.",

        "Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans.",
        "Bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.",
        "Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then turn out onto wire racks to cool completely.",
