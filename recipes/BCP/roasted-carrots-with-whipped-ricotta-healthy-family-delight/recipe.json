    "ingredients": [
        "1 pound carrots, peeled and cut into sticks",
        "2 tablespoons olive oil",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "1 cup ricotta cheese, preferably from Organic Valley",
        "2 tablespoons honey, plus extra for drizzling",
        "1 teaspoon chili flakes (adjust to your heat preference)",
        "Fresh parsley for garnish"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Seriously, it makes cleanup a breeze.",
        "Toss the carrot sticks in a bowl with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Make sure they're well-coated because flavor is key here.",
        "Spread the carrots on the baking sheet in a single layer. Roast them for about 25-30 minutes, turning halfway until they're browned and tender.",
        "While those are roasting, whip up the ricotta. Just throw it in a bowl with honey and a pinch of salt. Use a fork or a hand mixer (my KitchenAid works wonders) until it's smooth and creamy.",
        "Once the carrots are done, drizzle them with hot honey and sprinkle chili flakes on top. Plate them up with a dollop of the whipped ricotta and garnish with fresh parsley. It's gonna look gorgeous!"
    ],
    "tips": "OK, so here are some pro tips to really nail this dish:\n1. **Ingredient quality matters**: Use fresh carrots for that sweet flavor. I like to grab mine from Whole Foods.\n2. **Honey choice**: Use a good quality honey. I swear by local honey for the best taste.\n3. **Don’t skip the turning**: Flip those carrots halfway through roasting. It makes all the difference for even cooking.\n4. **Make ahead**: You can prep the carrots and ricotta a day in advance. Just roast them right before serving.\n5. **Adjust to your taste**: If you're not into spicy, skip the chili flakes. But if you love a kick, double the amount!\n",
