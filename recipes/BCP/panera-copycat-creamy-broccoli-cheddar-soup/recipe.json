    "ingredients": [
        "4 cups fresh broccoli florets, chopped",
        "1 medium onion, diced",
        "2 cloves garlic, minced",
        "4 cups vegetable broth",
        "1 cup heavy cream",
        "2 cups sharp cheddar cheese, grated",
        "2 tablespoons olive oil",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "1 teaspoon paprika for garnish"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute until fragrant.",
        "Add the chopped broccoli to the pot, followed by the vegetable broth. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the broccoli is tender.",
        "Using an immersion blender, puree the soup until smooth. If you prefer a chunkier texture, blend only half of the soup and leave the rest as is.",
        "Stir in the heavy cream and grated cheddar cheese, mixing until the cheese is fully melted and the soup is creamy. Season with salt, pepper, and paprika to taste.",
        "Serve hot, garnished with a sprinkle of paprika and additional cheese if desired. Enjoy your comforting bowl of soup!"
    ],
    "tips": "To enhance the flavor of your broccoli cheddar soup, consider using freshly grated cheese instead of pre-packaged to achieve a creamier consistency. Always taste and adjust seasoning before serving; a pinch of salt can elevate the flavors significantly. For a thicker soup, blend a portion of the broccoli before adding the cream. If you have leftovers, store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to three days. Reheat gently on the stove, adding a splash of broth if it thickens too much. Lastly, for a delightful twist, try adding a dash of nutmeg for warmth or a squeeze of lemon for brightness.",
