    "ingredients": [
        "2 cups oat milk (I love using Oatly)",
        "1 cup strong brewed chai tea (use your fav brand)",
        "1 tablespoon gingerbread syrup (you can find this at Trader Joe's)",
        "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
        "1\/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon",
        "Ice cubes",
        "Optional: whipped cream for topping"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Brew your chai tea according to package instructions. Make it strong! I usually let it steep for about 5 minutes.",
        "In a large glass or jar, combine the hot chai tea, oat milk, gingerbread syrup, vanilla extract, and ground cinnamon. Stir it up until everything’s mixed well.",
        "Let it cool for a minute or two, then pour it over a glass filled with ice cubes. Seriously, the ice is key here.",
        "If you’re feeling fancy, top it with whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon for that extra vibe.",
        "Sip and enjoy the cozy warmth of gingerbread spices, even as it’s iced. It’s like a hug in a glass!"
    ],
    "tips": "So, listen up! Here are some pro tips to nail this drink: \n\n- **Chai Tea Strength**: Make sure to brew your chai strong, like, seriously strong. You want that flavor to shine through all the oat milk.\n- **Gingerbread Syrup**: I use a gingerbread syrup from Starbucks, but you can totally make your own if you're feeling adventurous! Just mix equal parts sugar and water with ginger and spices.\n- **Oat Milk Choices**: Not all oat milks are created equal. I find Oatly gives the creamiest texture. You want that rich mouthfeel, right?\n- **Storage**: If you make extra, you can store it in the fridge for up to 2 days. Just give it a good shake before serving!\n- **Spice It Up**: Feel free to add some nutmeg or even a pinch of clove for a more complex flavor. Trust me, you’ll love it!",
