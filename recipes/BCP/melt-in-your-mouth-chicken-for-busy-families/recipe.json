    "ingredients": [
        "4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, trimmed",
        "2 tablespoons olive oil",
        "1 teaspoon garlic powder",
        "1 teaspoon paprika",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved",
        "1 cup fresh spinach, roughly chopped",
        "1\/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese",
        "Fresh basil for garnish"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Begin by preheating your oven to 400°F (200°C). While it warms up, season the chicken breasts with garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper on both sides.",
        "In a large oven-safe skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the seasoned chicken breasts and sear for about 5 minutes on each side until golden brown.",
        "Add the halved cherry tomatoes and chopped spinach around the chicken in the skillet. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the spinach wilts.",
        "Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the chicken and transfer the skillet to the preheated oven. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and the cheese is bubbly.",
        "Remove from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes. Garnish with fresh basil before serving.",
        "Serve hot with your choice of sides for a complete meal."
    ],
    "tips": "To ensure your chicken remains juicy, avoid overcooking it. Use a meat thermometer to check for an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C). When selecting chicken, look for breasts that are plump and have a pinkish hue. Common mistakes include not allowing the chicken to rest after cooking, which can lead to dryness. For storage, place leftovers in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days. Reheat gently in the oven or microwave to maintain moisture. If you're short on time, consider using pre-cooked chicken to reduce cooking time.",
