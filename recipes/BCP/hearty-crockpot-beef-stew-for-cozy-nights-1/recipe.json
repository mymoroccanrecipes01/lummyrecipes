    "tips": "When browning the beef, don't overcrowd the pan; this helps achieve that nice caramelization. A common mistake is skipping the browning step; it adds so much flavor! Leftovers can be stored in the fridge for up to 3 days, and it reheats beautifully on the stove or in the microwave. You can also swap out potatoes for sweet potatoes for a different twist!",
