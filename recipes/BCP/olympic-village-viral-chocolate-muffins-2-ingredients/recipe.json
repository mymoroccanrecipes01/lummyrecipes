    "ingredients": [
        "1 cup chocolate hazelnut spread",
        "2 large eggs",
        "1/2 cup all-purpose flour, sifted",
        "1/4 teaspoon baking powder",
        "1/4 teaspoon salt",
        "1/2 cup chocolate chips (optional)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a muffin tin with paper liners.",
        "In a mixing bowl, combine the chocolate hazelnut spread and eggs, whisking until smooth.",
        "Gently fold in the sifted flour, baking powder, and salt until just combined.",
        "If desired, stir in chocolate chips for an extra chocolatey flavor.",
        "Spoon the batter evenly into the prepared muffin cups, filling each about two-thirds full.",
        "Bake for 10 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cool before serving."
    ],
    "tips": "To ensure your muffins are perfectly moist, avoid overmixing the batter; mix until just combined. When selecting your chocolate hazelnut spread, look for one with a high cocoa content for richer flavor. Common mistakes include overbaking, which can lead to dry muffins, so keep an eye on them in the oven. For storage, keep them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to three days. If reheating, a quick 10-15 seconds in the microwave will restore their softness. For a more decadent treat, try adding a dollop of whipped cream on top when serving.",
