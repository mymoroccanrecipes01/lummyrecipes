        "1/2 teaspoon salt",
        "1/2 cup whole milk",

        "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
        "1 cup heavy cream",

        "In a bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.",

        "Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over low heat until thickened, about 5 minutes. Let cool.",

    "tips": "Make sure your donuts are completely cool before filling them to avoid melting the custard. If you don't have a kitchen torch, you can place them under a broiler for a minute, but watch closely! These donuts are best served fresh, but you can store them in an airtight container in the fridge for a day. For a twist, try adding a hint of orange zest to the custard for a citrusy flavor.",
