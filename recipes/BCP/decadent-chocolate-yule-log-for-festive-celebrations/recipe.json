    "ingredients": [
        "4 large eggs, separated",
        "1 cup granulated sugar, divided",
        "1\/2 cup all-purpose flour, sifted",
        "1\/3 cup cocoa powder, unsweetened (like Ghirardelli)",
        "1\/4 teaspoon baking powder",
        "1\/4 teaspoon salt",
        "1\/2 cup heavy cream (use Organic Valley for best results)",
        "1\/4 cup powdered sugar",
        "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
        "Chocolate shavings, for garnish"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a 15x10-inch baking pan with parchment paper, letting some hang over the edges. This makes it easier to lift out later.",
        "In a mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks with half the sugar until pale and thick. This step is crucial for that fluffy texture.",
        "Sift the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt into the yolk mixture. Gently fold until just combined, being careful not to overmix.",
        "In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until foamy, then gradually add the remaining sugar. Whip until stiff peaks form. Fold a third of the whites into the chocolate mixture, then gently fold in the remaining whites. You want to keep it light!",
        "Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan. Bake for about 20-25 minutes, or until the cake springs back when lightly pressed. It should look set but not dry.",
        "Once out of the oven, let it cool in the pan for about 5 minutes. Then, invert it onto a clean kitchen towel dusted with powdered sugar. Carefully peel off the parchment. Roll it up with the towel from the short side and let it cool completely."
    ],
    "tips": "1. Use fresh eggs for better volume when whisking egg whites. And trust me, it makes a difference! 2. Let the cake cool completely before unrolling to avoid cracks. I learned this the hard way (shocking, right?). 3. If it seems too dry, a splash of coffee or milk can add moisture. 4. For the filling, I always go for heavy cream; it makes everything richer and creamier. Use a KitchenAid mixer for the best results. 5. Don't stress if it cracks a little when rolling. You can cover it with frosting and no one will know!",
