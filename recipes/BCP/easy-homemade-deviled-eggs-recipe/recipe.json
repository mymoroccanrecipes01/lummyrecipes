    "ingredients": [
        "6 large eggs, hard-boiled and peeled",
        "1\/4 cup mayonnaise (I use Hellmann's)",
        "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard (trust me, it adds a kick)",
        "1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "Paprika for garnish",
        "Chopped fresh chives or parsley for garnish (optional)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "OK, so start by boiling your eggs. Place them in a pot, cover with cold water, and bring to a boil. Once boiling, cover and remove from heat. Let sit for 10 minutes.",
        "After the time’s up, transfer the eggs to an ice bath for about 5 minutes. This makes peeling way easier!",
        "Peel the eggs and slice them in half lengthwise. Scoop out the yolks into a bowl and place the whites on a serving platter.",
        "Mash the yolks with a fork and mix in the mayonnaise, mustard, apple cider vinegar, salt, and pepper until it’s nice and creamy. Taste it! Need more seasoning? Go for it.",
        "Spoon or pipe the yolk mixture back into the egg whites (my kids love the piping part!). Sprinkle with paprika and those fresh herbs if you’re using them.",
        "Serve immediately or chill until ready to wow your guests!"
    ],
    "tips": "Here’s a few things I’ve picked up over the years... First off, don't skip the ice bath after boiling. It really helps with peeling. And if you want a silkier filling, try adding a bit more mayo or even some sour cream (Bob's Red Mill is a good choice!). Also, if you’re making these for a party, do them the night before and just pop them in the fridge. They taste even better after chilling! One more thing - if your yolks are crumbly, you probably overcooked them. Experiment with timing next time. Trust me, it makes a difference!",
