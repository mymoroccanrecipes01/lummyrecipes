    "tips": "To elevate your sausage tortellini soup, consider these professional chef tips: \n- When selecting sausage, opt for high-quality Italian varieties for richer flavor. Look for fresh ingredients without fillers. \n- Avoid overcooking the tortellini; they should be al dente for the best texture. Keep an eye on them as they cook. \n- For storage, let the soup cool completely before transferring it to an airtight container. It can be refrigerated for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stove over low heat, adding a splash of broth if needed. \n- If you want to add more depth, consider incorporating a splash of white wine after sautéing the onions and garlic. This adds a lovely acidity that balances the richness of the sausage. \n- Always taste and adjust seasoning at the end; the broth and tomatoes can vary in saltiness, so it's essential to check before serving.",
