    "ingredients": [
        "1 box Jiffy corn muffin mix",
        "1 can creamed corn (15 oz)",
        "1 can whole kernel corn, drained (15 oz)",
        "1 cup shredded cheddar cheese (I use Kerrygold)",
        "1\/2 cup sour cream",
        "1\/4 cup melted butter",
        "1 teaspoon garlic powder",
        "1\/2 teaspoon salt",
        "1\/4 teaspoon black pepper"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 350°F. That’s the first step, folks.",
        "In a large mixing bowl, combine the Jiffy mix, creamed corn, and whole kernel corn. Mix it all up until it’s well combined.",
        "Add the shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream, melted butter, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Stir until everything is mixed together. Honestly? It’s super easy.",
        "Pour the mixture into a greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Spread it out evenly - no big clumps, OK?",
        "Bake for about 30 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly. You’ll know it's ready when the edges start to brown.",
        "Let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Trust me, it helps with the texture!"
    ],
    "tips": "Here are some pro tips to make this corn casserole even better:\n\n1. Use quality ingredients - I swear by Kerrygold cheese for that rich flavor. Don’t skimp!\n2. If you want a bit more texture, consider adding some diced jalapeños or bell peppers.\n3. For the best flavor, try to let it sit for 10 minutes after baking. It helps the casserole set up nicely.\n4. Leftovers? Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave, but it’s best in the oven to maintain that texture.\n5. Experiment with different cheeses! Cabot or Tillamook work great too. You can never have too much cheese, right?",
