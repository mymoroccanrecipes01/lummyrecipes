    "ingredients": [
        "4 cups fresh broccoli florets, chopped",
        "1 medium onion, diced",
        "2 cloves garlic, minced",
        "4 cups vegetable broth",
        "2 cups sharp cheddar cheese, shredded",
        "1 cup heavy cream",
        "2 tablespoons olive oil",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",

    "instructions": [

        "Using an immersion blender, carefully puree the soup until smooth. For a chunkier texture, blend only half of the soup and leave the rest as is.",
        "Stir in the heavy cream and shredded cheddar cheese, mixing until the cheese is fully melted and incorporated. Season with salt, pepper, and thyme to taste.",

    "tips": "To elevate your broccoli cheddar soup, consider these professional tips: \n- For a deeper flavor, roast the broccoli in the oven before adding it to the soup. This brings out a nutty sweetness. \n- When selecting cheese, opt for a high-quality sharp cheddar for the best flavor. Avoid pre-shredded cheese, as it contains anti-caking agents that can affect melting. \n- If you want a lighter version, substitute half of the cream with milk or a plant-based alternative. \n- To prevent the soup from curdling, add the cheese gradually and ensure the heat is low when incorporating dairy. \n- Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stove over low heat to maintain creaminess.",

Look for firm, bright green florets when shopping. To prepare, wash thoroughly and chop into bite-sized pieces for even cooking.</p><p><strong>Key seasonings/aromatics:</strong> Onion and garlic are key to building a flavorful base. Sautéing them releases their natural sweetness, enhancing the overall taste of the soup. Fresh herbs like thyme can also elevate the flavor profile.</p><p><strong>Supporting ingredients:</strong> Heavy cream adds a luscious texture, while sharp cheddar cheese brings a rich, tangy flavor. For a lighter option, consider using half-and-half or a dairy-free alternative.</p><p><strong>Smart substitutions:</strong> If you’re out of broccoli, cauliflower works well as a substitute, providing a similar texture. For a vegan version, use plant-based cheese and cream alternatives.</p><p><strong>Equipment needed:</strong> A large pot is essential for cooking the soup, and an immersion blender makes pureeing easy and mess-free. A cutting board and sharp knife are also necessary for prepping your ingredients.</p>"
