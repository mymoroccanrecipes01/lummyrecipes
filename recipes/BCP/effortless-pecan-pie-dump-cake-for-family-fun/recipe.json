    "servings": 8,
    "ingredients": [
        "1 cup chopped pecans",
        "1 box yellow cake mix (like Bob's Red Mill)",
        "1 cup unsalted butter, melted (I use Kerrygold)",
        "1 cup light brown sugar, packed",
        "1 cup sweetened condensed milk",
        "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
        "1\/2 teaspoon salt",
        "1\/2 teaspoon cinnamon"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish, so it’s ready to go.",
        "In a bowl, mix together the chopped pecans, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Set this aside.",
        "In another bowl, whisk together the melted butter, sweetened condensed milk, and vanilla extract. It’s gonna smell amazing!",
        "Spread the cake mix evenly over the greased dish, then pour the butter mixture on top. Don’t mix it; just let it layer.",
        "Sprinkle the pecan mixture over the top of everything. It’s like creating a cozy blanket for your cake!",
        "Bake for 45-50 minutes. The edges should be golden and bubbling. Let it cool for a bit before digging in..."
    ],
    "tips": "Alright, listen up! Here are some tips to nail this pecan pie dump cake: \n1. **Layering:** Don't stir the layers together; the top should stay crunchy while the bottom gets all gooey. \n2. **Pecan choice:** Use fresh pecans for the best flavor. If you can, toast them lightly before adding – it brings out their nuttiness! \n3. **Timing:** Bake until the top is golden brown. If it’s not bubbling, give it a few more minutes. \n4. **Storage:** This cake keeps well covered at room temperature for up to 3 days. You can also freeze slices – just wrap them well to avoid freezer burn. \n5. **Serving idea:** Serve warm, topped with vanilla ice cream, for an extra treat! Trust me, it’s a hit.",
