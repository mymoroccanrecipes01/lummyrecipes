    "ingredients": [
        "1 tablespoon olive oil",
        "1 medium onion, finely chopped",
        "3 cloves garlic, minced",
        "16 ounces fresh mushrooms, sliced",
        "4 cups vegetable broth",
        "1 cup heavy cream",
        "1 teaspoon dried thyme",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "Fresh parsley for garnish"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes.",
        "Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute until fragrant.",
        "Add the sliced mushrooms to the pot and cook until they are browned and have released their moisture, about 8-10 minutes.",
        "Pour in the vegetable broth and bring the mixture to a simmer. Add the dried thyme, salt, and pepper, and let it cook for another 10 minutes.",
        "Reduce the heat and stir in the heavy cream, allowing it to heat through without boiling.",
        "Blend the soup with an immersion blender until smooth, or leave it chunky for texture. Serve hot, garnished with fresh parsley."
    ],
    "tips": "To enhance the flavor of your mushroom soup, consider using a mix of different mushrooms such as shiitake or cremini for a more complex taste. When sautéing the onions, ensure they become soft and slightly caramelized for added sweetness. A common mistake is to rush the cooking of the mushrooms; allow them to brown properly to develop their full flavor. For storage, keep the soup in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stove, adding a splash of broth if it thickens too much. For a perfect creamy texture, avoid boiling the soup after adding the cream.",
