    "ingredients": [
        "6 large eggs, boiled and peeled",
        "1\/4 cup mayonnaise (I use Hellmann's)",
        "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard",
        "1 teaspoon white vinegar",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "Paprika for garnish",
        "Chives or parsley for garnish (optional)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Slice the boiled eggs in half lengthwise and scoop out the yolks into a mixing bowl. Set the egg whites aside.",
        "Mash the yolks with a fork until crumbly. Then, add the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, and white vinegar. Mix until smooth and creamy.",
        "Season with salt and pepper to taste. Honestly, it’s kinda up to you how much you want!",
        "Scoop or pipe the filling back into the egg white halves. I use a zip-top bag with the corner snipped off — it’s easy and looks nice.",
        "Sprinkle paprika on top for that classic look. And if you’re feeling fancy, add some chopped chives or parsley."
    ],
    "tips": "I’ve made these deviled eggs a bunch of times, and here’s what I learned: \n- Use fresh eggs for easier peeling. Seriously, the older they are, the better it is. \n- If you want to fancy it up, try adding some sriracha or pickles in the filling. Just a little kick! \n- If you’re making these ahead of time, keep the filling separate until serving to avoid soggy egg whites. \n- You can also swap the mayo for Greek yogurt for a lighter version — my friend Anna swears by it. \n- Lastly, if you’re short on time, just boil the eggs in advance and store them in the fridge for up to a week.",

If you can, use organic or free-range for better flavor.<\/p><p><strong>Key seasonings\/aromatics:<\/strong> Dijon mustard adds a tangy flavor that really uplifts the dish. I prefer Grey Poupon, but any good brand will do. It transforms the eggs from basic to something special.<\/p><p><strong>Supporting ingredients:<\/strong> Mayonnaise adds creaminess. I always reach for Hellmann's because it’s thick and rich. Just a few tablespoons can make a big difference in texture.<\/p><p><strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> If you want a lighter option, Greek yogurt can replace mayo (my friend Susan loves this). You could also try avocado for a guacamole twist!<\/p><p><strong>Equipment needed:<\/strong> A good mixing bowl and a fork are essential. I also recommend a piping bag or a zip-top bag for easy filling!<\/p>"
