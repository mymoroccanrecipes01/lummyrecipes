    "instructions": [
        "Begin by draining and rinsing the canned green beans under cold water to remove excess sodium.",
        "In a medium skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Once hot, add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant.",

    "tips": "To elevate your canned green beans, consider these tips: \n- For a richer flavor, try adding a splash of soy sauce or balsamic vinegar during cooking. This adds depth and a hint of sweetness. \n- Avoid overcooking the beans; they should be heated through but still retain a slight crunch for the best texture. \n- If you want a bit of heat, sprinkle in some red pepper flakes while sautéing the garlic. This will add a nice kick! \n- Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop or in the microwave. \n- Experiment with different herbs like thyme or dill for a fresh twist on flavor.",
