    "ingredients": [
        "1 box of vanilla pudding mix (like Jell-O)",
        "2 cups cold milk",
        "1 pound of fresh mixed berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries)",
        "1 store-bought pound cake, cut into slices",
        "1 cup whipped cream (I use Cool Whip)",
        "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
        "Mint leaves for garnish (optional)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "In a mixing bowl, whisk together the vanilla pudding mix and cold milk until it thickens, about 2 minutes. Set aside.",
        "In another bowl, fold the whipped cream into the pudding mixture gently, adding the vanilla extract too. You want it to be fluffy and light.",
        "Grab a trifle dish or a large glass bowl. Start layering! First, place a layer of cake slices at the bottom, then spread some pudding mixture.",
        "Next, add a layer of mixed berries. Repeat the layers until you've used everything up, finishing with pudding on top.",
        "Chill in the fridge for about 15 minutes to set. This helps the flavors blend nicely!",
        "Before serving, top with extra berries and mint leaves for a pop of color."
    ],
    "tips": "When it comes to making this trifle, a few things can make a big difference. First, use cold milk for the pudding to ensure it thickens up nicely. I always go for Bob's Red Mill pudding mix because it’s super reliable. Also, if you want to get fancy, layer some extra whipped cream on the top for that WOW factor! And honestly? You can swap the berries for whatever’s in season. Just be careful not to overdo it with the pudding; a little goes a long way. Oh, and if you make it ahead of time, let it sit in the fridge overnight. The flavors meld beautifully! Just don’t leave it too long or the cake will get soggy.",

Now I make it for my family every Sunday during the summer. My son, who usually skips dessert, said, \"Mom, THIS is the best!\"<\/p>"

Look for one that’s moist—trust me, it makes a difference. <strong>Key seasonings:<\/strong> The vanilla extract adds that extra warmth. I usually go for pure vanilla (like Nielsen-Massey) for the best flavor. <strong>Supporting ingredients:<\/strong> Fresh berries not only taste great but also add color and nutrition. I always pick ripe ones for the best sweetness. <strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> You can swap the pound cake for angel food cake for a lighter take. Or use yogurt instead of whipped cream if you want a lower-calorie option. <strong>Equipment needed:<\/strong> A trifle dish is ideal, but any glass bowl works too. A good whisk is key for getting that pudding nice and fluffy!<\/p>"
