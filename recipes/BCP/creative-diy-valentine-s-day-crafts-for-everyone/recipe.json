        "Start by gathering all your supplies on a clean workspace. Seriously, it makes the whole process easier.",
        "Cut out heart shapes from the colorful paper. You can do different sizes – small, medium, and large. I usually go with about 5 hearts.",
        "Now, grab your markers and write sweet messages or draw little designs on them. Don’t overthink it, just let your creativity flow!",
        "Once you're happy with the designs, it's time to assemble. Use glue or double-sided tape to stick them together in a fun arrangement. Aim for a layered look.",
        "If you wanna add some pizzazz, sprinkle on some glitter or stick on those embellishments. Totally optional but fun!",

    "tips": "Look, here's the thing: don't stress if your hearts aren't perfect. Crafting is about having fun! Also, if you mess up a heart, just flip it over and try again. I mean, it happens to the best of us. And for the glue, I like using a good quality brand - it makes a difference! Keep a wet cloth nearby for any sticky situations. Honestly, remember that the best part is sharing this time with loved ones, so enjoy it!",
