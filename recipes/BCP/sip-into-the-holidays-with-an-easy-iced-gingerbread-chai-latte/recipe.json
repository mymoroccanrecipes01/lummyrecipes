    "ingredients": [
        "2 cups brewed chai tea, cooled",
        "1 cup oat milk (I use Oatly)",
        "2 tablespoons gingerbread syrup (homemade or store-bought)",
        "1\/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon",

        "Brew your chai tea and let it cool down completely. This is key, trust me.",
        "In a large glass, mix the cooled chai with oat milk and gingerbread syrup. Stir it like you mean it!",
        "Add a sprinkle of ground cinnamon, but you might wanna go heavy if you're feeling spicy.",
        "Fill another glass with ice cubes, then pour that delicious mixture over the ice.",
        "Top it off with whipped cream and another sprinkle of cinnamon for flair. It's all about that presentation!"
    ],
    "tips": "1. Use a KitchenAid frother for creamy oat milk - it makes a world of difference. 2. Want more spice? Consider adding a pinch of nutmeg or cardamom. 3. If you’re short on time, use store-bought gingerbread syrup, but homemade is always a plus. 4. My first attempt was too sweet because I added way too much syrup - now I measure it out! 5. This drink keeps well in the fridge for a day, but the ice will dilute it, so maybe skip the ice if you're prepping ahead.",

I usually go for McCormick’s brand because it’s super aromatic.
