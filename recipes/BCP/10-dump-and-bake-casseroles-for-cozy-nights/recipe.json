        "2 cups cooked chicken, shredded",
        "1 cup mixed vegetables, frozen or fresh",
        "1 can cream of mushroom soup",
        "1 cup shredded cheddar cheese",
        "1 cup cooked rice or pasta",
        "1 teaspoon garlic powder",

        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "1/2 cup breadcrumbs for topping"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the shredded chicken, mixed vegetables, cream of mushroom soup, cooked rice or pasta, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Mix until well combined.",
        "Transfer the mixture into a greased 9x13 inch baking dish, spreading it evenly. Sprinkle the shredded cheddar cheese on top.",
        "In a small bowl, mix the breadcrumbs with a drizzle of olive oil until they are lightly coated. Sprinkle this mixture over the cheese layer for added crunch.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until the casserole is bubbling and the top is golden brown.",
        "Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. This allows the flavors to meld beautifully.",
        "Serve warm, garnished with fresh herbs if desired."
    ],
    "tips": "For a creamier casserole, consider adding a splash of milk or sour cream to the mixture. When selecting your vegetables, opt for a colorful mix to enhance both nutrition and presentation. Avoid overcooking the chicken initially, as it will continue to cook in the oven. If you want to make this dish ahead of time, assemble it and store it in the fridge for up to 24 hours before baking. For reheating, cover with foil and bake at 350°F (175°C) for about 20 minutes or until heated through.",
