    "ingredients": [
        "1 pound ground beef, browned and drained",
        "4 medium potatoes, thinly sliced",
        "1 onion, diced",
        "2 cups shredded cheddar cheese",
        "1 can cream of mushroom soup",
        "1 cup milk",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "1 teaspoon garlic powder",
        "1 teaspoon paprika",
        "Fresh parsley for garnish"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium heat until browned. Drain excess fat and set aside.",
        "In a mixing bowl, combine the cream of mushroom soup and milk, whisking until smooth. Season with garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper.",
        "In a greased 9x13 inch baking dish, layer half of the sliced potatoes, followed by half of the cooked beef, and half of the diced onion. Pour half of the soup mixture over the layers.",
        "Repeat the layering process with the remaining potatoes, beef, onions, and soup mixture. Top with shredded cheddar cheese.",

    ],
    "tips": "To ensure your hobo casserole is a hit, consider these tips: \n- Use fresh potatoes for the best texture. If using pre-packaged potatoes, adjust cooking time as needed. \n- Browning the beef thoroughly adds depth of flavor; don’t rush this step. \n- For a creamier texture, add a bit more milk to the soup mixture. \n- Avoid overcooking the casserole; check for doneness after the initial baking time to prevent mushy potatoes. \n- Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days; reheat in the oven for best results, or microwave for quick meals.",
