        "First, cook the quinoa. In a medium pot, combine 2 cups of water and quinoa. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and let simmer for about 15 minutes until water is absorbed.",
        "While the quinoa is cooking, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Toss in the cubed chicken, sprinkle with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Cook for about 7-10 minutes until the chicken is browned and cooked through.",
        "Add the diced red bell pepper, zucchini, and broccoli to the skillet. Sauté for another 5-7 minutes until veggies are tender but still crisp.",
        "Once the quinoa is done, fluff it with a fork and mix in the lemon juice and chopped parsley. This adds a fresh kick!",
        "Divide the quinoa among meal prep containers, top with the chicken and veggies mixture, and let cool before sealing."

    "tips": "Meal prepping is a breeze if you keep a few things in mind. First off, I always use my KitchenAid mixer for any chopping or mixing; it saves time and effort. Make sure to use fresh veggies whenever possible; they really make a difference in flavor. I also recommend investing in good quality meal prep containers; they keep everything organized and fresh. Don't be afraid to vary the proteins or veggies based on what you have on hand. And if you're feeling adventurous, add some spices like cumin or paprika to jazz it up! Trust me, a little extra seasoning can go a long way.",

But after making my first batch, I felt super proud. My kids ate everything without complaints! Now I do it every Sunday, and it’s become a family ritual. The smell of grilled chicken and veggies fills the house, and I love watching my family dig in!<\/p>"

            "content": "<p><strong>Main ingredient (quinoa):<\/strong> Quinoa is my go-to base because it’s packed with protein and fiber. Look for organic varieties if you can; they taste fresher. Rinse it well before cooking to remove any bitterness. <strong>Key seasonings:<\/strong> I always go with garlic powder and lemon juice; they brighten the entire dish. Kerrygold butter adds a richness if you want to jazz it up. <strong>Supporting ingredients:<\/strong> Fresh veggies like zucchini and bell peppers not only add color but also crunch. Be sure to cut them evenly for even cooking. <strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> You can swap chicken for turkey or tofu if you’re looking for a lighter option. I also love adding black beans for extra protein. <strong>Equipment needed:<\/strong> A good cutting board is essential, and my trusty KitchenAid mixer makes the chopping a breeze.<\/p>"

You’ll know the quinoa is done when it’s fluffy and the water is absorbed. <strong>Finishing touches:<\/strong> Once everything is cooked, mix them together and serve it in meal prep containers.
