    "ingredients": [
        "1/2 cup popcorn kernels, popped",
        "1 cup granulated sugar",
        "1/4 cup unsalted butter",
        "1/4 cup light corn syrup",
        "2 tablespoons gochujang",
        "1/2 teaspoon baking soda",
        "1/4 teaspoon salt",
        "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Begin by popping the popcorn kernels using your preferred method. Once popped, place them in a large mixing bowl and set aside.",
        "In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the sugar, butter, corn syrup, and gochujang. Stir continuously until the mixture comes to a boil.",
        "Allow the caramel to boil without stirring for about 4-5 minutes, or until it reaches a golden amber color. Keep a close eye to prevent burning.",
        "Remove the saucepan from heat and quickly stir in the baking soda, salt, and vanilla extract. The mixture will bubble up, so be cautious.",
        "Pour the caramel over the popped popcorn, using a spatula to gently fold and coat the popcorn evenly. Allow it to cool slightly before serving."
    ],
    "tips": "For the best results, use fresh popcorn kernels to ensure maximum fluffiness. If you want a more intense flavor, consider adding an extra tablespoon of gochujang to the caramel mixture. Be careful when boiling the caramel; it can quickly go from perfect to burnt. To store, keep the popcorn in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. If you want to re-crisp the popcorn, place it in a preheated oven at 250°F (120°C) for about 10 minutes. This will help restore its crunchiness.",
