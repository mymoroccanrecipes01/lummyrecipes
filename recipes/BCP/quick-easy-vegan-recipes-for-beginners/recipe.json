    "ingredients": [
        "1 cup quinoa, rinsed and drained",
        "2 cups vegetable broth (or water)",
        "1 bell pepper, diced",
        "1 zucchini, chopped",
        "1 can black beans, drained and rinsed",
        "1 teaspoon cumin",
        "1 teaspoon chili powder",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "Fresh cilantro for garnish"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Start by cooking your quinoa. Bring the vegetable broth to a boil in a medium saucepan, add the rinsed quinoa, and reduce to a simmer. Cover and cook for about 15 minutes until the liquid is absorbed.",
        "While that’s cooking, heat a splash of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Toss in your diced bell pepper and chopped zucchini. Sauté for about 5-7 minutes until they’re tender and slightly caramelized.",
        "Next, add the drained black beans, cumin, chili powder, salt, and pepper to the skillet. Mix everything together and let it cook for another 5 minutes to let those flavors combine.",
        "Once the quinoa is done, fluff it up with a fork and combine it with the sautéed veggies and beans. Stir it all together until well mixed.",
        "Serve warm, garnished with fresh cilantro. Dig in and enjoy!"
    ],
    "tips": "1. Use a KitchenAid mixer to fluff your quinoa effortlessly. 2. If you like it spicy, add some diced jalapeños to the skillet. 3. Leftover quinoa? Toss it in salads or wraps the next day. 4. I usually double the spices for extra flavor, so don’t hesitate! 5. Storing? Keep in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days.",

I love using Bob's Red Mill spices for their freshness. <strong>Supporting ingredients:<\/strong> Fresh veggies add color and nutrition; I often swap in whatever I have on hand. <strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> You can use brown rice instead of quinoa for a heartier bite. Or, if you're feeling wild, try farro for a nutty flavor! <strong>Equipment needed:<\/strong> A good skillet is essential for sautéing, and I always reach for my trusty non-stick pan.<\/p>"
