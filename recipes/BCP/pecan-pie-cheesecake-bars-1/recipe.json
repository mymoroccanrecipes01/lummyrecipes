    "difficulty": "Easy",

    "cook_time": 30,
    "servings": 12,
    "ingredients": [
        "1 cup graham cracker crumbs",
        "1\/4 cup granulated sugar",
        "1\/2 cup unsalted butter, melted",
        "16 ounces cream cheese, softened",
        "1 cup brown sugar, packed",
        "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
        "3 large eggs",
        "1 cup pecans, chopped",
        "1\/2 cup corn syrup",
        "1\/4 teaspoon salt"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a 9x13 inch baking pan with parchment paper, allowing some overhang for easy removal later.",
        "In a mixing bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, granulated sugar, and melted butter until the mixture resembles wet sand. Press this mixture firmly into the bottom of the prepared pan to form a crust.",
        "In a large bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until smooth. Gradually add the brown sugar and vanilla extract, mixing until fully incorporated. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.",
        "Pour the cream cheese mixture over the crust and spread it evenly. In another bowl, mix the chopped pecans, corn syrup, and salt. Spoon this mixture over the cheesecake layer, spreading it gently.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes, or until the edges are set and the center has a slight jiggle. Allow to cool completely in the pan before lifting out and cutting into bars."
    ],
    "tips": "To achieve the best texture, ensure your cream cheese is at room temperature before mixing; this prevents lumps. When selecting pecans, look for fresh, fragrant nuts for the best flavor. Be careful not to overbake; the cheesecake should be slightly wobbly in the center when you take it out. For storage, keep the bars in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to five days. Reheat individual bars in the microwave for about 10-15 seconds for a warm treat. If you're making these ahead of time, they freeze well; just wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and foil, and they can last up to three months in the freezer.",
