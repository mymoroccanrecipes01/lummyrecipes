    "ingredients": [
        "1 cup all-purpose flour",
        "1/2 teaspoon baking powder",
        "1/4 teaspoon salt",
        "1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened",
        "1/2 cup granulated sugar",
        "1 large egg",
        "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
        "1 cup heavy cream",
        "1/4 cup powdered sugar",
        "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract (for cream)",
        "4 oz semisweet chocolate, chopped",
        "2 tablespoons unsalted butter (for glaze)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.",
        "In a bowl, mix together flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.",
        "In another bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg and vanilla extract.",
        "Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture until just combined.",
        "Drop tablespoon-sized balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes until the edges are lightly golden.",
        "While the cookies cool, whip the heavy cream with powdered sugar and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form.",
        "Once the cookies are cooled, sandwich them with the whipped cream filling.",
        "For the glaze, melt the chocolate and butter together, stirring until smooth. Drizzle over the cookies before serving."

    "tips": "A key tip for these cookies is to let them cool completely before adding the filling; otherwise, it might melt. If you're short on time, store-bought whipped cream can work in a pinch. You can also substitute the chocolate glaze with a simple dusting of powdered sugar for a lighter option.",
