    "ingredients": [
        "6 cups Rice Krispies cereal",
        "4 tablespoons unsalted butter (I use Kerrygold for the best flavor)",
        "1 package (10 oz) mini marshmallows",
        "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
        "Sprinkles for decoration (optional)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "In a large pot, melt 4 tablespoons of butter over low heat. Keep it low to avoid burning, okay?",
        "Once melted, stir in the mini marshmallows and mix until they’re all gooey and melted. This should take about 2-3 minutes.",
        "Remove the pot from heat and add in the vanilla extract. This part? Totally essential for flavor!",
        "Now, add the Rice Krispies cereal to the marshmallow mixture. Stir it up until everything is well-coated. Use a spatula for this - trust me.",
        "Spread the mixture into a greased 9x13 inch pan. Press it down firmly (but don’t crush it). Let it cool for about 30 minutes before cutting into squares."
    ],
    "tips": "OK, here are some pro tips to make your Rice Krispie Treats even better:\n\n- **Temperature control:** When melting the marshmallows, keep the heat low. If it’s too high, they’ll scorch. You want them gooey, not burnt!\n- **Mixing:** Stir quickly but gently as you add the cereal. You don’t wanna break them up too much.\n- **Storage:** Store in an airtight container. They’ll stay fresh for about 3 days, but I doubt they’ll last that long! \n- **Decorating:** Sprinkles not only make them pretty, but they add a little crunch. My kids love them!\n- **Batch size:** If you find they disappear faster than expected, double the recipe! Seriously, they go quick.",
