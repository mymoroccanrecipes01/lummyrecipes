    "ingredients": [
        "2 cups ginger snap cookies, crushed",
        "1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted",
        "1 can (15 oz) pumpkin puree",
        "1 cup cream cheese, softened",
        "1 cup powdered sugar",
        "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
        "1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice",
        "1 cup whipped cream, for topping"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "In a mixing bowl, combine the crushed ginger snap cookies and melted butter until well blended. Press this mixture firmly into the bottom of a 9-inch pie dish to form the crust.",
        "In another bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until smooth. Gradually add the powdered sugar, mixing until fully incorporated.",
        "Stir in the pumpkin puree, vanilla extract, and pumpkin pie spice until the mixture is creamy and well combined.",

    ],
    "tips": "To ensure your crust holds together, make sure to press it firmly into the dish. If you prefer a spicier kick, consider adding a pinch of cayenne pepper to the pumpkin filling. When selecting pumpkin puree, look for 100% pure pumpkin without additives for the best flavor. For a lighter version, you can substitute half of the cream cheese with Greek yogurt. This dessert can be made a day in advance, making it perfect for gatherings. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to three days.",
