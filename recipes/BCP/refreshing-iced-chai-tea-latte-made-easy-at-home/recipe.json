    "tips": "When making iced chai tea lattes, feel free to adjust the sweetness to your taste. A common mistake is not letting the tea steep long enough, which can result in a weak flavor. If you want to make it creamier, try using oat milk or almond milk. This drink is best enjoyed fresh, but if you have leftovers, store them in the fridge for a day. Just give it a good stir before serving again!",
