    "ingredients": [
        "1 tablespoon olive oil",
        "1 medium onion, diced",
        "2 cloves garlic, minced",
        "2 medium carrots, sliced",
        "2 celery stalks, chopped",
        "1 teaspoon dried oregano",
        "1 teaspoon dried thyme",
        "6 cups vegetable broth",
        "1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes, undrained",
        "1 cup small pasta (like ditalini or orzo)",
        "1 cup cooked chicken, shredded",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "Fresh parsley, chopped for garnish"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes.",
        "Stir in the minced garlic, sliced carrots, and chopped celery. Cook for an additional 3-4 minutes until the vegetables begin to soften.",
        "Sprinkle in the dried oregano and thyme, stirring well to combine the flavors. Pour in the vegetable broth and diced tomatoes, bringing the mixture to a gentle boil.",
        "Once boiling, add the small pasta and cook according to package instructions, usually around 8-10 minutes, until al dente.",
        "Stir in the shredded chicken and season with salt and pepper to taste. Let simmer for another 5 minutes to heat through.",
        "Serve hot, garnished with fresh parsley for a vibrant finish."
    ],
    "tips": "To enhance the flavor of your soup, consider using homemade broth for a richer taste. When selecting vegetables, opt for fresh, seasonal produce to maximize flavor and nutrition. A common mistake is overcooking the pasta; add it towards the end of cooking to maintain its texture. For storage, keep the soup in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. To reheat, warm gently on the stove, adding a splash of water or broth if it thickens too much. For a quicker meal, you can use rotisserie chicken instead of cooking your own.",
