    "ingredients": [
        "4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts",
        "1 cup apple cider",
        "2 tablespoons olive oil",
        "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard",
        "1 teaspoon garlic powder",

    "tips": "To elevate your apple cider chicken, consider these professional tips: \n- For the best flavor, use high-quality apple cider. Look for options that are unfiltered and free from additives. This will enhance the sweetness and depth of your dish. \n- Avoid overcooking the chicken by using a meat thermometer; aim for an internal temperature of 165°F (75°C). This ensures juicy, tender meat. \n- If you want a thicker sauce, let it simmer longer after removing the chicken. Just be careful not to let it burn. \n- Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently in a skillet over low heat to maintain moisture. \n- Experiment with different herbs like rosemary or sage for a unique twist on the flavor profile.",
