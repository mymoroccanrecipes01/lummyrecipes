When shopping, look for shrimp that are firm and have a slight sheen, indicating freshness. For best results, thaw frozen shrimp in the refrigerator overnight before cooking.</li><li><strong>Key seasonings/aromatics:</strong> Garlic is essential for building flavor, adding a rich, aromatic quality. Fresh garlic is best, but pre-minced can be used in a pinch. Red pepper flakes add a subtle heat that enhances the dish.</li><li><strong>Supporting ingredients:</strong> Olive oil and butter create a luscious sauce that coats the shrimp beautifully. The lemon juice adds brightness and balances the richness, while parsley provides a fresh finish.</li><li><strong>Smart substitutions:</strong> If you prefer, you can substitute shrimp with scallops or chicken breast, adjusting cooking times accordingly. For a vegetarian option, consider using mushrooms or tofu.</li><li><strong>Equipment needed:</strong> A large skillet is essential for even cooking and easy tossing of the shrimp. A good quality spatula will help you stir without damaging the shrimp.</li></ul></p>"
