    "ingredients": [
        "1 large red onion, thinly sliced",
        "1 cup apple cider vinegar",
        "1 cup water",
        "1 tablespoon sugar",
        "1 tablespoon salt",

    ],
    "instructions": [
        "So, first off, slice the onion really thin. Like, paper-thin if you can. It'll pickle better that way.",
        "In a saucepan, combine the apple cider vinegar, water, sugar, and salt. Heat it over medium until the sugar dissolves. You're not trying to boil it, just warm it up.",
        "Now, pack those sliced onions into a jar. If you wanna get fancy, add peppercorns or garlic cloves in there too.",
        "Pour the warm vinegar mixture over the onions. Make sure they’re completely submerged. If not, just push them down a bit.",
        "Let them cool for about 30 minutes, then pop on the lid and stick them in the fridge. They’re ready in a few hours, but honestly, they taste even better the next day!"
    ],
    "tips": "Listen, here are some tips to nail these pickled onions:\n- Use a mandoline if you have one. It makes slicing super easy and uniform.\n- I always let them pickle overnight. The flavors really meld together.\n- Don't skip the sugar! It balances out the tang from the vinegar.\n- Store them in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. But trust me, they'll probably be gone way before then!\n- Experiment with spices! I sometimes toss in a few mustard seeds or some chili flakes for an extra kick.",

When shopping, look for firm onions without blemishes. Slice them thin for better pickling.<br><strong>Key seasonings:<\/strong> Apple cider vinegar is my go-to for its fruity flavor. It really transforms the dish. You can also use white vinegar if that's what you have.<br><strong>Supporting ingredients:<\/strong> Sugar balances the acidity, making it a little less tart. Salt helps draw out moisture from the onions, allowing them to soak up all that flavor.<br><strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> You could swap in a sweet onion for a milder taste or use red wine vinegar for a different twist. If you're out of sugar, honey works too but will change the flavor slightly.<\/p>"
