    "tips": "One key tip for this stew is to sear the beef before adding it to the crockpot. This adds depth of flavor you'll really appreciate! Also, don’t skip the Worcestershire sauce; it gives the stew a rich, savory kick. Leftovers store well in the fridge for up to 3 days and can be reheated on the stove or in the microwave. If you want to lighten it up, feel free to add more veggies like green beans or bell peppers!",
