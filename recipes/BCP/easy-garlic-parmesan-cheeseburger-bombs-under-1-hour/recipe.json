    "ingredients": [
        "1 lb ground beef",
        "1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, plus more for topping",
        "1\/2 cup grated parmesan cheese (I use Kerrygold)",
        "1 tsp garlic powder",
        "1\/2 tsp onion powder",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "1 can refrigerated biscuit dough (like Pillsbury)",
        "Marinara sauce for dipping"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 375°F. Seriously, this is key for a good bake.",
        "In a bowl, mix the ground beef, mozzarella, parmesan, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Get in there with your hands - it’s messy but fun!",
        "Open the biscuit dough and separate it into individual pieces. Flatten each biscuit in your hand, then place a generous spoonful of the beef mixture in the center.",
        "Fold the edges of the biscuit over the filling and pinch to seal. Place seam side down on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.",
        "Bake for about 25-28 minutes or until golden brown. The smell will be like a warm hug...",
        "Serve with marinara sauce on the side for dipping. Trust me, it’s a game changer!"
    ],
    "tips": "OK, so here are some tips from my experience: \n- Use fresh ingredients whenever possible. I always go for Kerrygold cheese because it really amps up the flavor.\n- If you want a little kick, throw in some red pepper flakes into the beef mixture.\n- Leftovers? They reheat beautifully in the oven, just pop them in at 350°F for about 10 minutes. I promise they won’t dry out!\n- And if you don't have ground beef, ground turkey works too. Just adjust cooking time slightly. \n- Lastly, don’t skip the garlic powder. It’s what makes these bombs, well, bombastic!",

You want it to be juicy, not dry, so aim for 80\/20.\n<strong>Key seasonings\/aromatics:<\/strong> Garlic powder is a must for that flavor punch. I also like to add a bit of Worcestershire sauce sometimes for depth. Just a splash goes a long way!\n<strong>Supporting ingredients:<\/strong> The cheeses make these bombs super creamy and satisfying. I recommend using good mozzarella, and the parmesan really kicks it up a notch.\n<strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> If you want a leaner option, ground turkey or chicken works. Just keep in mind the cooking time may vary. You can also use crescent roll dough instead of biscuit dough for a flakier texture.\n<strong>Equipment needed:<\/strong> A good baking sheet is essential. I use my trusty old one – it’s seen better days but still works great!<\/p>"

The key here is to incorporate everything evenly. Bake until golden brown, and you’ll know they’re done when the kitchen smells good.\n<strong>Finishing touches:<\/strong> Once out of the oven, let them cool for a few minutes before serving.
