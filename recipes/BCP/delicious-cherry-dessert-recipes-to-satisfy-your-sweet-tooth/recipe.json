    "ingredients": [
        "2 cups fresh cherries, pitted",
        "1 cup granulated sugar",
        "1 tablespoon cornstarch",
        "1 tablespoon lemon juice",
        "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",

    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). That's the sweet spot for baking this tart.",
        "In a mixing bowl, combine the pitted cherries, sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. Toss everything together until cherries are well-coated.",
        "Roll out the pie crust in a tart pan and press it down firmly. Leave some overhang to fold over the edges later.",
        "Pour the cherry mixture into the crust, spreading it evenly. Dot the top with little pieces of butter.",
        "Fold the overhanging crust over the filling, creating a rustic edge. Brush with a bit of melted butter if you want.",
        "Bake for about 30 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. Let it cool before serving."

    "tips": "Here’s what I’ve learned about making this cherry tart: \n1. Fresh cherries are key – look for ones that are firm and shiny. The flavor is just so much better.\n2. I always use a pre-made pie crust because it saves time (but if you wanna make your own, go for it!).\n3. If the cherries are super sweet, you might wanna cut back on the sugar a bit. Adjust based on your taste.\n4. Let it cool completely before slicing. It helps the filling set up nicely. \n5. Leftovers? They’re even better the next day, trust me on this!",
