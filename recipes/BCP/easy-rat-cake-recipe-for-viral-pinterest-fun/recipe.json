    "ingredients": [
        "1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour, sifted",
        "1 ½ cups granulated sugar",
        "¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder (I use Ghirardelli)",
        "1 ½ teaspoons baking powder",
        "1 ½ teaspoons baking soda",
        "1 teaspoon salt",
        "2 large eggs",
        "1 cup whole milk",
        "½ cup vegetable oil",
        "2 teaspoons vanilla extract",
        "1 cup boiling water",
        "Buttercream frosting for decoration (Kerrygold butter recommended)",
        "Chocolate shavings for garnish"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two round cake pans. Trust me, you don't want it to stick later.",
        "In a large bowl, mix the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Use a whisk for that nice airy texture.",
        "Add the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla to the dry mixture. Beat on medium speed for about 2 minutes. Then, stir in the boiling water slowly. The batter will be super thin. That's how it’s supposed to be!",
        "Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let them cool completely.",
        "Once cooled, frost with buttercream to create the whimsical rat design, using chocolate shavings for ears and nose. Get creative here!",
        "Lastly, decorate with any fun accents you want. Maybe some edible glitter? Make it yours!"
    ],
    "tips": "OK, so here are some pro tips: \n1. Make sure to sift your dry ingredients; it really helps with the texture. It’s a game changer for cakes! \n2. If you want a deeper chocolate flavor, consider adding an extra tablespoon of cocoa powder. Just don’t overdo it. \n3. When frosting, use a piping bag for those intricate designs; it makes all the difference. I’m not proud of this, but I’ve used a ziploc bag in a pinch. \n4. Store leftover cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to three days. It keeps well - if there’s any left, that is!",

It’s best made with Kerrygold for that creamy texture. <strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> If you're out of eggs, try using applesauce instead.
