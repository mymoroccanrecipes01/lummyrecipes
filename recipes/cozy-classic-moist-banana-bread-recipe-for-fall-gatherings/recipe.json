        "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 4x8 inch loaf pan, or line it with parchment paper.",
        "In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until smooth. Stir in the melted Kerrygold butter.",
        "Add the baking soda and salt to the banana mixture. Then mix in the brown sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract until combined.",
        "Gradually add the flour, mixing just until everything comes together. If you wanna, fold in the chocolate chips for an extra treat.",
        "Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth out the top. Bake for about 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.",
        "Let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing."

    "tips": "Look, here are some pro tips to help you nail this banana bread:\n\n1. Use overripe bananas - the darker, the better. They’re sweeter and mash easier.\n2. Don't overmix the batter! A few lumps are totally fine. You want it to be tender, not tough.\n3. If you’re worried about it sticking, I recommend using a non-stick spray or a good layer of butter.\n4. To store leftovers, wrap it in plastic wrap and keep it at room temp for a few days. It also freezes really well - just slice it up first!\n5. Feel free to experiment with add-ins like nuts or dried fruits. Just keep the proportions the same for best results.",

I use pure vanilla for a richer taste.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Supporting ingredients:<\/strong> The all-purpose flour gives the bread its structure. Sift it for a lighter loaf if you want.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> You can swap in whole wheat flour for a denser texture. Applesauce can replace some butter for a lower-fat version.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Equipment needed:<\/strong> A good mixing bowl and a whisk are essential for this.
