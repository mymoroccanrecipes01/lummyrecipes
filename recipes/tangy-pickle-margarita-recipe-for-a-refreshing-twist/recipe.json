    "tips": "For the best flavor, use fresh lime juice instead of bottled. If you prefer a sweeter drink, adjust the amount of triple sec to your taste. Always taste your margarita before serving to ensure the balance of flavors is to your liking. If you want to make a larger batch, simply multiply the ingredients by the number of servings needed. Store any leftover pickle juice in the refrigerator for future cocktails or to add to salads for an extra zing.",
