    "ingredients": [
        "1 pre-made pie crust (store-bought or homemade)",
        "1 cup pecans, chopped",
        "1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips (I like Ghirardelli)",
        "3\/4 cup brown sugar, packed",
        "1\/4 cup corn syrup",
        "4 large eggs",
        "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
        "1\/4 teaspoon salt",
        "1\/2 cup unsalted butter (Kerrygold works great), melted"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This is key for getting that crust nice and golden.",
        "In a mixing bowl, combine the melted butter, brown sugar, and corn syrup. Whisk it all together until smooth.",
        "Add in the eggs, vanilla extract, and salt. Mix until everything is well combined. Trust me, it's gonna smell so good!",
        "Fold in the chopped pecans and chocolate chips, making sure they get evenly distributed.",
        "Pour the filling into the pie crust, spreading it out evenly. Bake for about 30 minutes, or until the center is set but still slightly jiggly.",
        "Let it cool for at least 15 minutes before slicing. It's gonna be hard to resist, but trust me, it’s worth the wait."
    ],
    "tips": "Here are some tips to help you nail this pie: \n1. If you want an extra flaky crust, chill it for 30 minutes before baking. It helps a lot! \n2. Don't skip the cooling time! It allows the filling to set properly, so the slices hold up beautifully. \n3. Use a glass pie dish if you can; it helps with even baking. \n4. Got leftovers? Store them in the fridge for up to 3 days. Just reheat slices in the microwave for a few seconds. \n5. Feel free to switch up the nuts! Walnuts or even a mix could work well.",
