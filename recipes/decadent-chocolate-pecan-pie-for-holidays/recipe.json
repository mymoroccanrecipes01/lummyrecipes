    "ingredients": [
        "1 pre-made pie crust, thawed",
        "1 cup pecan halves, toasted",
        "1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips",
        "3 large eggs, beaten",
        "1 cup corn syrup",
        "1 cup brown sugar, packed",
        "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
        "1/4 teaspoon salt"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Place the pie crust in a pie dish and set aside.",
        "In a saucepan over low heat, melt the chocolate chips until smooth, stirring frequently to prevent burning.",
        "In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, corn syrup, brown sugar, vanilla extract, and salt until well combined.",
        "Gradually stir the melted chocolate into the egg mixture until fully incorporated.",
        "Fold in the toasted pecans, then pour the filling into the prepared pie crust.",
        "Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until the filling is set and slightly puffed. Allow to cool before serving."
    ],
    "tips": "To ensure a perfect pie, start with a well-chilled crust to prevent shrinking during baking. When toasting pecans, keep a close eye on them to avoid burning; they should be fragrant and lightly browned. If the edges of your pie crust start to brown too quickly, cover them with foil to prevent overcooking. For a richer flavor, consider using dark chocolate instead of semi-sweet. Store any leftovers in the refrigerator for up to three days, and reheat gently in the oven to maintain the crust's texture.",
