    "tips": "When making this iced chai latte, you can totally adjust the sweetness to your taste. If you prefer a stronger chai flavor, brew your tea a little longer. I like to use Bob's Red Mill organic chai tea bags for a really rich taste. And if you want it creamier, try using half-and-half instead of regular milk. Don't forget - letting the tea cool completely before mixing is key to keeping the ice from melting too fast. Also, I always make a double batch because my kids love it and it disappears faster than you can say 'chai latte'!",
