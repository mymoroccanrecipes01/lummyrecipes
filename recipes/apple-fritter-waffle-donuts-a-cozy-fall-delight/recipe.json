    "ingredients": [
        "1 cup all-purpose flour (I use Bob's Red Mill)",
        "2 tbsp sugar",
        "1 tsp baking powder",
        "1\/2 tsp cinnamon",
        "1\/4 tsp nutmeg",
        "1\/2 tsp salt",
        "1\/2 cup milk (I prefer whole milk for richness)",
        "1 large egg",
        "1\/2 cup diced apples (Granny Smith works great)",
        "1\/4 cup melted Kerrygold butter",
        "1 cup powdered sugar (for glaze)",
        "2 tbsp milk (for glaze)",
        "1\/2 tsp vanilla extract (for glaze)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "OK, so first thing, preheat your waffle maker. I usually set it to medium-high. While that's heating up, mix the dry stuff together in a bowl: flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt.",
        "In another bowl, whisk the egg, then add the milk and melted butter. Combine these wet ingredients with the dry ones until it’s all just blended. It’s OK if there are a few lumps – don’t overmix!",
        "Now fold in those diced apples. You want them evenly distributed, but don’t go crazy – just a gentle mix. Trust me, the chunks will be delicious!",
        "Once your waffle maker is ready, scoop some batter onto it. I usually use about 1\/3 cup per donut. Close the lid and let them cook for about 3-5 minutes. You want them golden brown – like, really golden.",
        "While those are cooking, mix up your glaze. Just whisk together the powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla until smooth. It should be drizzly but thick enough to coat. Adjust with more milk or sugar as needed.",
        "When the donuts are done, remove them carefully and drizzle that sweet glaze on top. Serve warm because they taste best fresh out of the waffle maker!"
    ],
    "tips": "Alright, here are some tips that’ll help you nail these donuts: \n1. **Don’t skip the resting time** - let the batter sit for 5 minutes before cooking. It helps the texture! \n2. **Check your waffle maker’s heat** - if they’re browning too fast, lower the heat a bit. My old one likes to run hot. \n3. **Use fresh apples** - they give the best flavor. I usually go for tart varieties like Granny Smith. \n4. **Make it fun** - try adding some chopped nuts or even a sprinkle of chocolate chips for a twist! \n5. **Storage tip** - these are best eaten fresh, but if you have leftovers, store them in an airtight container for up to 2 days. Reheat in the toaster for a quick warm-up!",
