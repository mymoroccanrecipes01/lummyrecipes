    "ingredients": [
        "12 ounces linguine pasta",
        "1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces",
        "1\/4 cup unsalted butter",
        "3 cloves garlic, minced",
        "1 teaspoon smoked paprika",
        "1\/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper",
        "1\/2 cup heavy cream",
        "1\/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "Fresh parsley, chopped for garnish"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Begin by cooking the linguine according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside, reserving a bit of the pasta water.",
        "In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant.",

        "Pour in the heavy cream and bring to a gentle simmer. Stir in the Parmesan cheese until melted and the sauce is creamy.",

    "tips": "To elevate your Cowboy Butter Chicken Pasta, consider these professional tips: \n- When selecting chicken, opt for breasts that are uniform in size for even cooking. Trim any excess fat for a cleaner presentation. \n- For an extra depth of flavor, let the garlic sauté until it's just golden, but avoid burning it to prevent bitterness. \n- If you prefer a milder dish, adjust the cayenne pepper to taste, or omit it altogether. \n- This dish can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stove with a splash of cream or broth to restore its creaminess. \n- Always taste your sauce before serving; a pinch of salt can enhance the overall flavor significantly.",
