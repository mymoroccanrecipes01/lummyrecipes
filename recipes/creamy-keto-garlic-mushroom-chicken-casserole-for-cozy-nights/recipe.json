    "tips": "One key tip is to let the casserole sit for a few minutes after baking; it helps the flavors meld together beautifully. A common mistake is overcooking the chicken, so keep an eye on it while sautéing! If you're out of mozzarella, feel free to substitute with cheddar or a cheese blend for a different flavor twist.",
