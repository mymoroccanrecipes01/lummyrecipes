    "ingredients": [
        "2 pounds beef chuck, cut into bite-sized pieces",
        "4 cups beef broth (homemade or store-bought)",
        "3 large carrots, sliced",
        "3 potatoes, diced",
        "1 onion, chopped",
        "3 cloves garlic, minced",
        "2 tablespoons tomato paste",
        "1 teaspoon dried thyme",
        "1 teaspoon dried rosemary",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "2 tablespoons olive oil",
        "1 cup frozen peas",
        "1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the beef chunks and brown them on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. Seriously, don't overcrowd the pot or they won't brown right.",
        "Remove the beef and set it aside. In the same pot, add the chopped onion and garlic, cooking until they're fragrant and the onion is translucent, about 3-4 minutes.",
        "Stir in the tomato paste, thyme, and rosemary. Let that simmer for a minute, then return the beef to the pot.",
        "Pour in the beef broth and add the carrots and potatoes. Bring everything to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and let it simmer for about 1.5 hours. You'll know it's ready when the beef is super tender.",
        "In the last 15 minutes, add the frozen peas and Worcestershire sauce. If it seems thick, add a little more broth or water.",
        "Serve hot in bowls, maybe with some crusty bread on the side. Your kitchen will smell amazing!"
    ],
    "tips": "Honestly, there are a few things I wish someone had told me before diving into this stew. First, browning the beef properly is key—don’t rush that step or you’ll miss out on flavor. I personally use Kerrygold butter for any sautéing because it adds such a rich taste. And if you like a thicker stew, just mix a tablespoon of cornstarch with cold water and stir it in during the last 10 minutes of cooking. My KitchenAid slow cooker is a lifesaver for this, too! You can prep everything the night before, pop it in, and wake up to a delicious meal. And if you have leftovers? They get even better the next day!",

Look for well-marbled pieces at the store for the best flavor.<br><strong>Key seasonings:<\/strong> Thyme and rosemary bring out that classic stew aroma, and I always go for dried because they pack a punch. I use Bob's Red Mill herbs whenever possible.<br><strong>Supporting ingredients:<\/strong> The veggies add texture and color, plus they soak up all that rich broth. I like to cut them into similar sizes for even cooking.<br><strong>Smart substitutions:<\/strong> If you’re short on time, pre-cut frozen veggies can work in a pinch. Also, you can swap beef for chicken for a lighter version if that's your jam.<br><strong>Equipment needed:<\/strong> A heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven is crucial here to get that even heat distribution.<\/p>"
