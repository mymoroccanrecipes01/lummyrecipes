    "ingredients": [
        "2 pounds beef chuck, cut into 1-inch cubes",
        "4 cups beef broth",
        "3 medium carrots, sliced",
        "2 large potatoes, diced",
        "1 onion, chopped",
        "3 cloves garlic, minced",
        "2 tablespoons tomato paste",
        "1 teaspoon dried thyme",
        "1 bay leaf",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "2 tablespoons olive oil"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the beef cubes and sear them until browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes.",
        "Remove the beef from the pot and set aside. In the same pot, add the chopped onion and garlic, sautéing until softened and fragrant, about 3-4 minutes.",
        "Stir in the tomato paste, thyme, and bay leaf, cooking for another minute to enhance the flavors.",
        "Return the beef to the pot and pour in the beef broth. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover, allowing it to simmer for about 1.5 hours.",
        "After 1.5 hours, add the carrots and potatoes to the stew. Continue to simmer for an additional 30 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.",
        "Season with salt and pepper to taste before serving hot."
    ],
    "tips": "For the best flavor, choose well-marbled beef chuck, as it becomes tender during cooking. Searing the meat first adds depth to the stew's flavor. Avoid overcrowding the pot when browning the beef to ensure a good sear. If you have leftovers, store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stove over low heat to maintain the stew's texture. For a thicker stew, you can mix a tablespoon of cornstarch with water and stir it in during the last 10 minutes of cooking.",
