    "ingredients": [
        "2 cups cooked pasta, any shape",
        "1 cup shredded cheese, your choice",
        "1 can cream of mushroom soup",
        "1 cup mixed vegetables, frozen or fresh",
        "1 teaspoon garlic powder",
        "1 teaspoon onion powder",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "1\/2 cup breadcrumbs for topping",
        "2 tablespoons olive oil"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Gather all your ingredients to streamline the process.",
        "In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked pasta, cream of mushroom soup, mixed vegetables, garlic powder, onion powder, and half of the cheese. Season with salt and pepper.",
        "Transfer the mixture into a greased baking dish, spreading it evenly. Top with the remaining cheese and breadcrumbs, then drizzle with olive oil.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly.",
        "Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. This allows the flavors to meld beautifully."
    ],
    "tips": "When making casseroles, consider using leftover proteins like chicken or beef for added flavor and ease. Ensure your pasta is slightly undercooked, as it will absorb some moisture while baking. If you're short on time, pre-chop your vegetables and store them in the fridge. For a creamier texture, add a splash of milk or broth to the mixture before baking. Lastly, experiment with different cheeses for varied flavor profiles; sharp cheddar or mozzarella can elevate your dish significantly.",
