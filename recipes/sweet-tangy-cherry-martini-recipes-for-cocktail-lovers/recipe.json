    "ingredients": [
        "1 cup fresh cherries, pitted",
        "2 ounces vodka (I recommend Tito's)",
        "1 ounce fresh lemon juice",
        "1 ounce simple syrup (you can make this by dissolving sugar in equal parts water)",
        "Ice cubes",
        "Extra cherries for garnish"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Start by muddling the fresh cherries in a cocktail shaker. You want to break them down a bit to release their juices, so go for about 30 seconds.",
        "Add the vodka, fresh lemon juice, and simple syrup to the shaker. Fill it with ice cubes, but don't overdo it - just enough to chill the mixture.",
        "Shake vigorously for about 15-20 seconds until it's nice and cold. You’ll see the shaker get frosty - that's when you know it’s ready.",
        "Strain the mix into a chilled cocktail glass. If you want to be fancy, you can use a fine mesh strainer to catch any cherry bits.",
        "Garnish with a few cherries on top for that visual pop. Serve immediately and enjoy!"
    ],
    "tips": "Here are some pro tips to make your cherry martini even better! \n- Use fresh cherries when they’re in season for the best flavor. Trust me on this - frozen ones just don’t cut it. \n- If you're feeling adventurous, try adding a splash of orange liqueur for a twist. It brings out the cherry flavor nicely. \n- Don't have simple syrup? No problem! Just dissolve some sugar in warm water and let it cool before using. \n- Always chill your glass ahead of time. A cold martini glass makes a HUGE difference in the drinking experience. \n- If you want a sweeter drink, just add a bit more simple syrup - adjust to your taste!",
