        "1 cup fresh cherries, pitted",

    "instructions": [
        "Begin by pitting the fresh cherries and placing them in a cocktail shaker. Muddle the cherries gently to release their juices.",
        "Add the vodka, cherry liqueur, and fresh lemon juice to the shaker. Fill the shaker with ice cubes to chill the mixture.",
        "Secure the lid on the shaker and shake vigorously for about 15 seconds until well combined and chilled.",

    "tips": "To elevate your cherry martini, consider using high-quality vodka for a smoother taste. When muddling cherries, be gentle to avoid overly breaking them down, which can lead to a gritty texture. If you prefer a sweeter drink, adjust the amount of cherry liqueur to your liking. For storage, it's best to prepare the cocktail fresh, but if you have leftovers, keep them in the fridge for up to 24 hours. Always serve your martini chilled for the best experience, and consider pre-chilling your glasses for an extra touch of sophistication.",
