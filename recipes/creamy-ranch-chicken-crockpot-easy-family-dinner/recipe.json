    "ingredients": [
        "2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts",
        "1 packet ranch seasoning mix (I use Hidden Valley)",
        "1 cup chicken broth",
        "1 cup heavy cream (Organic Valley works great)",
        "1 cup shredded cheddar cheese (Kerrygold is my go-to)",
        "1 cup chopped carrots",
        "1 cup chopped celery",
        "Salt and pepper to taste"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Start by placing the chicken breasts at the bottom of your crockpot. Kinda like laying the foundation, you know?",
        "Mix the ranch seasoning with the chicken broth and pour it over the chicken. Totally makes it juicy.",
        "Add in those chopped carrots and celery. They add a nice crunch and flavor. Seriously, don't skip it.",
        "Cover the crockpot and cook on low for about 6 hours. You'll know it's ready when the chicken shreds easily.",
        "Once it's done, stir in the heavy cream and cheese. Mix until it’s all creamy and smooth. The smell? Unreal.",
        "Serve it warm over rice or mashed potatoes. Your family will be asking for seconds, trust me."
    ],
    "tips": "OK, so here are some tips to nail this dish:\n1. Make sure to cut the chicken into smaller pieces if you're in a hurry. They'll cook faster and shred easier.\n2. If you want a bit of a kick, add some diced jalapeños or red pepper flakes when mixing in the ranch seasoning.\n3. For a lighter version, swap the heavy cream for half-and-half. It’ll still taste great!\n4. I usually double the ranch seasoning because who doesn't love that flavor?\n5. This dish freezes really well, so make extra and save some for a busy night.",
