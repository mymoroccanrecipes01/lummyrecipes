    "servings": 4,
    "ingredients": [
        "1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces",
        "2 tablespoons olive oil",
        "1 medium onion, diced",
        "2 cloves garlic, minced",
        "2-3 jalapeños, seeded and finely chopped",
        "1 cup heavy cream",
        "1 cup chicken broth",
        "1 teaspoon smoked paprika",
        "Salt and pepper to taste",
        "Fresh cilantro for garnish"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced onion and sauté until translucent, about 3-4 minutes.",
        "Stir in the minced garlic and chopped jalapeños, cooking for an additional 2 minutes until fragrant.",
        "Add the chicken pieces to the skillet, seasoning with salt, pepper, and smoked paprika. Cook until the chicken is browned and cooked through, about 6-8 minutes.",
        "Pour in the chicken broth and bring to a gentle simmer. Reduce heat and stir in the heavy cream, allowing the mixture to thicken for about 5 minutes.",
        "Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. Serve hot, garnished with fresh cilantro."
    ],
    "tips": "To ensure your chicken stays juicy, avoid overcooking it. Use a meat thermometer to check for an internal temperature of 165°F. When selecting jalapeños, choose firm ones with smooth skin for the best flavor. If you prefer a milder dish, remove the seeds and membranes from the jalapeños. For storage, keep leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop over low heat to maintain creaminess. If you want to add more depth to the dish, consider adding a splash of lime juice before serving for a bright finish.",
